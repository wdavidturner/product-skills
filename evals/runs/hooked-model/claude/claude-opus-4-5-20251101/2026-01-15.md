# The Hooked Model for Building Habit-Forming Products

The Hooked Model, created by **Nir Eyal**, is a four-phase cycle that explains how products create habits. The goal is to bring users back repeatedly without relying on expensive advertising or aggressive messaging.

## The Four Phases

```
┌─────────────┐
│   TRIGGER   │ ← External (notification, email) or Internal (emotion, routine)
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   ACTION    │ ← Simplest behavior in anticipation of reward
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│  VARIABLE   │ ← Unpredictable rewards that create craving
│   REWARD    │
└──────┬──────┘
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│ INVESTMENT  │ ← User puts something in, loading the next trigger
└──────┬──────┘
       │
       └────────────► (loops back to Trigger)
```

## Phase 1: Trigger

Triggers prompt the behavior. There are two types:

- **External triggers**: Push notifications, emails, app icons, word of mouth
- **Internal triggers**: Emotions (boredom, loneliness, uncertainty) or routines

The goal is to move users from external triggers to internal ones. When someone feels bored and automatically opens Instagram without a notification—that's an internal trigger.

## Phase 2: Action

The action is the **simplest behavior done in anticipation of a reward**. It must be easier than thinking.

Fogg Behavior Model: **B = MAT** (Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger)

To increase action:
- Reduce friction (fewer clicks, less thinking)
- Increase ability (make it obvious what to do)
- Ensure trigger is present at the right moment

**Example**: Scrolling a feed is nearly effortless. Posting a photo requires more effort and happens less frequently.

## Phase 3: Variable Reward

This is what creates craving. The **unpredictability** matters as much as the reward itself. There are three types:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Tribe** | Social rewards—validation, acceptance, connection | Likes, comments, followers |
| **Hunt** | Search for resources or information | Scrolling feeds, slot machines, deals |
| **Self** | Mastery, competence, completion | Leveling up, clearing inbox, streaks |

**Key insight**: Predictable rewards don't create habits. Variable rewards do.

## Phase 4: Investment

Users put something into the product that:
1. **Stores value** (data, followers, reputation, content)
2. **Loads the next trigger** (sets up future engagement)

Investment increases switching costs and makes the product better with use.

**Examples**:
- Adding friends (stores value + creates future triggers)
- Customizing preferences (product improves)
- Creating content (builds history that's hard to leave)

## When to Use This Model

- Designing consumer products that need repeat engagement
- Analyzing why users aren't returning
- Building features that increase retention
- Evaluating whether your product can become a habit

## When NOT to Use It

- Products used infrequently by design (tax software, moving apps)
- B2B products where habit isn't the goal
- When usage frequency is too low to form habits (less than weekly)

## The Habit Zone

Products must be used **frequently enough** to become habits:

```
High Frequency + High Perceived Utility = Habit Zone
Low Frequency = Need external triggers forever
```

If your product is used monthly, it likely can't become a habit—you'll always need to remind people it exists.

## Ethical Consideration: The Manipulation Matrix

Eyal proposes testing your product:

| | **Materially improves life** | **Doesn't improve life** |
|---|---|---|
| **Maker uses it** | Facilitator ✓ | Entertainer |
| **Maker doesn't use it** | Peddler | Dealer ✗ |

Build products you'd use yourself that genuinely help people.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Relying only on external triggers** — You can't notify your way to habit formation
2. **Making rewards predictable** — Removes the craving mechanism
3. **Skipping investment** — No stored value = easy to leave
4. **Wrong internal trigger** — Misunderstanding what emotion drives usage
5. **Action too hard** — If it requires thought, it's not a habit

### scenario

Prompt:

```
Users love our app when they use it, but they forget to come back. We're sending tons of notifications but it feels spammy. How do we create genuine habits?
```

Response:

```
Here's your diagnosis and path forward:

## Your Problem: External Triggers Without Internal Triggers

You're treating the symptom (users don't return) with more symptoms (more notifications). This creates a vicious cycle: more spam → more opt-outs → fewer reachable users → even more spam to remaining users.

**The real question isn't "How do we remind users to come back?"**

**It's: "What internal trigger do we want to own, and how do we become the automatic response to it?"**

## The Fix: Build the Full Hook

### 1. Discover Your Internal Trigger
Interview your power users (the ones who DO come back unprompted):
- "When did you last open the app without a notification?"
- "What were you doing/feeling right before?"
- "Walk me through that moment."

You're looking for the **emotion** that precedes opening: boredom, uncertainty, FOMO, anxiety about forgetting something, loneliness, etc.

### 2. Design External Triggers to *Train* the Association
Use notifications strategically to connect the internal trigger to your product:
- Only notify at moments when users would naturally feel the internal trigger
- Reduce frequency as the habit forms
- Goal: users eventually open without the notification

### 3. Make the Action Stupidly Easy
When the trigger fires (internal or external), the action must require near-zero effort. Every friction point breaks the habit loop.

### 4. Deliver Variable Rewards
Predictable rewards don't create craving. What's *different* each time they open? Social validation, new content, progress?

### 5. Design Investments That Load the Next Trigger
After the reward, what can users do that creates a reason to return?
- Follow someone → their activity triggers return
- Create content → engagement notifications trigger return
- Set a goal → progress updates trigger return

## Quick Diagnostic

Ask yourself:
- Do you know what emotion precedes your power users opening the app?
- Could users open your app without any notifications and still find value?
- Does using your product create a reason to come back tomorrow?

If you answered "no" to any of these, that's where to focus — not on notification frequency.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me map our fitness app to the Hooked model. What's the trigger, action, variable reward, and investment? Where are we weakest?
```

Response:

```
Now I have the framework. To help map your fitness app to the Hooked model, I need to understand what your app does. Could you share:

1. **What's the core action** users take in your app? (log workouts, track calories, follow video workouts, etc.)
2. **What brings users back today?** (notifications, streaks, social features, personal records?)
3. **What data or content do users create/store?** (workout history, photos, friends list?)

In the meantime, here's the Hooked Model framework we'll use:

```
┌─────────┐     ┌─────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ TRIGGER │────▶│ ACTION  │────▶│   VARIABLE  │────▶│ INVESTMENT  │
│         │     │         │     │   REWARD    │     │             │
└─────────┘     └─────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
      ▲                                                    │
      └────────── Investment loads the next trigger ───────┘
```

**Common fitness app weaknesses by phase:**

| Phase | Typical Weakness |
|-------|------------------|
| **Trigger** | Over-reliance on push notifications; no clear internal trigger owned |
| **Action** | Logging workouts requires too many taps; friction kills the habit |
| **Variable Reward** | Progress is predictable (you gain strength linearly); lacks "hunt" or "tribe" rewards |
| **Investment** | Workout history doesn't load the next trigger; data sits dormant |

Share your app details and I'll do a specific diagnosis.
