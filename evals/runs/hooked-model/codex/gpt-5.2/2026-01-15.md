Prompt:

```
Walk me through the Hooked model for building habit-forming products.
```

Response:

```
The Hooked model (Nir Eyal) is a 4-step loop for designing products people return to because they build an internal habit: **Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment**. You repeat the loop until the user starts initiating it without external prompting.

1) Trigger  
A cue that tells the user “do this now.”
- External triggers: push/email, ads, a friend’s message, a home-screen icon, a CTA in the UI.
- Internal triggers: an emotion or routine thought (bored, lonely, anxious, “I should check…”, “I wonder if…”).  
Design goal: use external triggers early, but build toward internal triggers so users return unprompted.  
Questions to ask:
- What user situation/emotion reliably precedes use?
- Can the product become the default response to that situation?

2) Action  
The simplest behavior done in anticipation of reward.
- Make it easy: reduce steps, reduce cognitive load, clear next action, fast performance.
- Increase motivation ethically: clear value proposition, social proof, progress cues.  
Design goal: the user can take the core action with minimal friction at the moment of the trigger.  
Questions to ask:
- What is the one “keystone” action that produces value (scroll, post, save, message, log, play)?
- What friction can be removed (time, effort, uncertainty, complexity)?

3) Variable Reward  
A satisfying payoff with some variability (not always the same outcome), which increases curiosity and repeat behavior. Common types:
- Tribe (social): likes, replies, community recognition.
- Hunt (resources): new info, deals, content, opportunities.
- Self (mastery): progress, completion, personal bests, streak milestones (use carefully).  
Design goal: deliver real value, but with enough novelty/uncertainty that users want to check again.  
Questions to ask:
- What reward actually matters to this user segment?
- Where does variability naturally exist (fresh content, new messages, changing status, progress insights)?

4) Investment  
The user puts something into the product that increases the chance they return.
- Examples: following people/topics, setting preferences, uploading data, creating content, building a history, training recommendations, making commitments, inviting teammates.
- Key idea: investment often happens after the reward (when the user is most satisfied), and it increases future value and future triggers.  
Design goal: each loop leaves the user with more “stored value” and a reason to come back.  
Questions to ask:
- What can the user do now that makes the next experience better?
- How does that investment create future triggers (notifications, personalized feed, saved work)?

How to apply it (quick walkthrough)
- Define the habit you want: “When [internal trigger], user does [action] to get [reward].”
- Prototype the loop: pick one trigger, one core action, one reward, one investment mechanic.
- Measure the loop, not just the funnel: trigger→action conversion, time-to-action, reward engagement, and repeat rate (next-day/next-week return).
- Iterate on the weakest link: most products fail because triggers are misaligned, the action is too hard, the reward isn’t meaningful, or investment doesn’t compound value.

Important cautions
- Habits should align with genuine user benefit; “sticky” without value becomes churn, backlash, or harm.
- Use variable rewards responsibly; avoid exploiting anxiety/compulsion, especially in sensitive domains (kids, gambling-like mechanics, mental health).

If you tell me the product idea and target user, I can map a concrete Hooked loop (one sentence per step) and suggest the first experiment to validate it.

**Explaining the Hooked Model**

The user is looking for an explanation without any code changes, so I need to focus directly on the topic. I’ll explain Nir Eyal's Hooked model, covering the key components: Trigger, Action, Variable Reward, and Investment. I want to provide a straightforward walk-through and practical examples while being thorough yet concise. Also, I’ll include metrics, ethical considerations, and potential pitfalls to make sure the explanation is complete and helpful!

### scenario

Prompt:

```
Users love our app when they use it, but they forget to come back. We're sending tons of notifications but it feels spammy. How do we create genuine habits?
```

Response:

```
To create genuine habits, shift from “more pings” to “repeatable value loops” where users *want* to return because the product reliably helps them achieve a goal.

**1) Start with one habit, not retention in general**
- Pick the single repeat action that most predicts long-term retention (the “core action”).
- Define the user promise in one line: “When you do X, you get Y benefit within Z minutes.”
- If Y isn’t immediate/credible, notifications can’t fix it—improve time-to-value first.

**2) Build a habit loop inside the product (cue → action → reward → investment)**
- **Cue (internal > external):** Create in-app cues that appear *right when the user is already thinking about the problem* (dashboards, saved views, “continue where you left off”).
- **Action:** Make the next best step obvious and 1-tap (defaults, templates, smart suggestions).
- **Reward:** Deliver a clear “win” every session (progress, insight, relief, delight). Add “variable” rewards carefully (fresh insights, new opportunities) without randomness that feels gimmicky.
- **Investment:** Get users to save preferences, set goals, create a library, follow topics/people, or schedule—things that make the next session better.

**3) Redesign notifications as a “service,” not a channel**
- Send fewer, higher-intent notifications tied to *user-defined goals* (not your calendar).
- Use a simple rule: **Don’t notify unless (a) it’s timely, (b) personalized, (c) actionable in <30s, and (d) meaningfully better than waiting.**
- Add a **preference center** (frequency + topics + quiet hours) and default to the minimum.
- Segment by lifecycle: **new (guide to first win), active (help maintain streak/progress), lapsing (remind of unfinished value), churned (one strong win-back, then stop).**

**4) Create return triggers that aren’t interrupts**
- Scheduled value: digests, weekly recaps, “your progress since last time,” upcoming deadlines—opt-in and predictable.
- Social/commitment loops (if natural): shared goals, accountability, collaboration updates that users *expect*.

**5) Measure habits with the right lens**
- Track cohorts by “core action” frequency (e.g., 2+ times/week) and time-to-first-win.
- Audit every notification: open rate isn’t enough—measure “notification → core action → next-week retention.”
- Run experiments: reduce notification volume by 30–50% while increasing relevance; you often see retention stay flat or improve due to reduced fatigue.

If you tell me what the app does and what your “core action” is (plus your current best retention cohort), I can suggest 2–3 concrete habit loops and a notification policy with example messages.

**Providing product advice**

I’m thinking about how to give product advice without using tools. I want to keep it concise yet thoughtful. Key points should include avoiding spammy notifications and focusing on internal triggers, timing, segmentation, and user engagement. I might ask for context, but since the user asked generally, I'll offer a framework. I'll define a core habit loop, choose a key behavior, and suggest creating cues inside the product while implementing personalized triggers. I'll outline actionable steps across sections like Diagnosis, Building loops, Notifications redesign, and Measurement.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me map our fitness app to the Hooked model. What's the trigger, action, variable reward, and investment? Where are we weakest?
```

Response:

```
**Hooked Model Mapping (Typical Fitness App)**  
- **Trigger**: External = push/SMS/email reminders, calendar prompts, coach messages, “you’re close to your goal” nudges; Internal = guilt after missed days, stress → desire for relief, identity (“I’m a healthy person”), fear of losing a streak, wanting visible progress.  
- **Action**: Open app → start workout / follow plan / log activity or meal; simplest “doable in 10 seconds” action is “Start” or “Log done” with minimal typing.  
- **Variable Reward**: “Self” = unexpected PRs, streak milestones, encouraging insights; “Tribe” = reactions, challenges, leaderboard movement; “Hunt” = new workouts/unlocks, adaptive recommendations; variability comes from progress pace, social feedback, and personalized insights (not just predictable badges).  
- **Investment**: Goal setup, preferences, training plan selection, saving workouts, connecting wearables, logging history, building streak, inviting friends/coach, creating content (templates/routines), notifications tuned—anything that makes next action faster and rewards more personalized.

**Where fitness apps are usually weakest (likely candidates)**  
- **Variable reward** is often too predictable (badges/streaks feel same-y), or not meaningfully personalized to the user’s goals and context.  
- **Investment → payoff loop** is often weak: users log data, but the app doesn’t “give back” enough (clear guidance, adaptive plan changes, insight quality), so logging feels like work.

If you share 1) your core habit (workouts, steps, nutrition, etc.), 2) your main retention loop today (what brings users back), and 3) your top 2 engagement features, I can map *your* product precisely and call out the single weakest link with concrete fixes.

**Mapping fitness app using Hooked model**

I need to provide a mapping without using code or tools. So, let's use the Hooked model with triggers, actions, rewards, and investments. For a typical fitness app, external triggers could be push notifications while internal triggers might include feelings of guilt or desire. Actions would involve opening the app or starting a workout. The variable rewards could be progress, badges, and social feedback. Investments might include user profiles or saved workouts.

I'll keep it concise and suggest that the weakest areas are likely the variable rewards and investments, which can feel too predictable or insufficient.
thinking
**Structuring the response**

I want to keep my response organized and clear, so I’m thinking of using a bullet list with headings. I won’t reference any specific skills since the user hasn’t named any. I’ll make sure to include a weakness analysis offering hypotheses followed by one or two suggestions for each point. 

Also, I should definitely wrap up with 3 to 5 questions to encourage further discussion. This way, I can provide a thoughtful response that invites the user to engage more!
