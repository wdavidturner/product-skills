# Opportunity Solution Trees (OST)

Opportunity Solution Trees are a visual framework created by **Teresa Torres** that connects a desired **outcome** to **opportunities** (customer needs/pain points) to **solutions** to **experiments**. It's a thinking tool that keeps teams outcome-focused while exploring multiple paths.

## The Structure

```
        [Desired Outcome]
              │
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ▼         ▼         ▼
[Opportunity] [Opportunity] [Opportunity]
    │              │
  ┌─┴─┐          ┌─┴─┐
  ▼   ▼          ▼   ▼
[Sol] [Sol]    [Sol] [Sol]
  │               │
  ▼               ▼
[Experiment]   [Experiment]
```

## Building One Step-by-Step

### 1. Start with a Clear Outcome (Not Output)

Pick a measurable business or product outcome your team owns.

- **Wrong**: "Launch notifications feature" (that's output)
- **Right**: "Increase 7-day retention from 25% to 35%"

The outcome should be something you can influence but not directly control.

### 2. Discover Opportunities Through Customer Research

Opportunities are **unmet needs, pain points, or desires** expressed in the customer's language. You find these through:

- Continuous customer interviews (weekly habit)
- Support tickets and feedback
- Behavioral data showing friction

**Key principle**: Opportunities come from customers, not conference rooms. Don't brainstorm what you *think* customers need.

### 3. Map Opportunities as a Hierarchy

Structure opportunities from broad to specific:

```
Outcome: Increase retention
├── Hard to remember to come back
│   ├── No reason to return daily
│   └── Forget the app exists
├── Initial value unclear
│   ├── Setup takes too long
│   └── Don't know what to do first
└── Content gets stale
    └── Same recommendations every time
```

Each level down gets more specific and actionable.

### 4. Select ONE Opportunity to Focus On

Don't try to solve everything. Pick based on:
- Size of impact on outcome
- How many customers it affects
- Whether you can actually address it
- Strategic alignment

### 5. Generate Multiple Solutions (Compare & Contrast)

For your chosen opportunity, brainstorm **at least 3 different solutions**. This prevents falling in love with your first idea.

```
Opportunity: "Forget the app exists"
├── Solution A: Push notifications
├── Solution B: Email digest
├── Solution C: Calendar integration
└── Solution D: SMS reminders
```

### 6. Test Assumptions with Small Experiments

Don't build the whole solution. Identify the **riskiest assumption** and test it cheaply:

| Solution | Riskiest Assumption | Experiment |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| Push notifications | Users will enable them | Survey existing users on notification preferences |
| Email digest | Users read email from us | Check open rates on current emails |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with solutions** — "We should add notifications" skips the opportunity
2. **Opportunities that are really solutions in disguise** — "Need a dashboard" vs "Can't understand my progress"
3. **Not updating the tree** — It's a living document, not a one-time exercise
4. **Too many branches** — Focus on 1 opportunity at a time
5. **Flat structure** — Break big opportunities into smaller, actionable ones

## Quick Application Checklist

- [ ] Outcome is measurable and team-controllable
- [ ] Opportunities came from actual customer research
- [ ] Opportunities are phrased as needs, not solutions
- [ ] Tree has hierarchical structure (broad → specific)
- [ ] Focusing on ONE opportunity branch at a time
- [ ] Generated 3+ solutions to compare
- [ ] Testing assumptions before building

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We have a clear outcome goal but 50 different ideas for how to achieve it. The team is paralyzed by options. How do we prioritize discovery work?
```

Response:

```
This is a classic "opportunity sprawl" problem. You need a structured way to narrow down before diving into discovery. Here's how to approach it:

## Immediate Triage: The 2x2 Filter

Score each idea quickly (15 min exercise) on two dimensions:

1. **Confidence in the opportunity** - Do we have evidence customers actually have this problem?
2. **Potential impact** - If we nail this, how much does it move the outcome metric?

```
                    High Impact
                         │
         EXPLORE         │        PRIORITIZE
    (needs validation)   │    (strong candidates)
                         │
  ───────────────────────┼───────────────────────
                         │
         IGNORE          │         QUESTION
    (low value, low      │    (why do we think
     confidence)         │     this is valuable?)
                         │
                    Low Impact
        Low Confidence ←───→ High Confidence
```

**Kill the bottom-left quadrant immediately.** You just went from 50 to ~25.

## Next: Stack Rank the Survivors

For remaining ideas, do a quick forced ranking using these questions:

1. **How often does this problem occur?** (daily > weekly > monthly > rarely)
2. **How painful is it when it happens?** (blocking > frustrating > annoying > minor)
3. **Can we uniquely solve this?** (differentiated > competitive > commodity)

Ideas that score high on frequency + severity + differentiation go to the top.

## Then: Run Parallel Discovery Sprints

Don't serialize discovery on 25 ideas. Instead:

- **Pick 3-5 top opportunities** to explore simultaneously
- **Timebox to 2 weeks** - enough for 5-8 customer conversations per opportunity
- **Set a kill threshold** - "If we can't find 3 customers who describe this problem unprompted, we move on"

## The Meta-Question

Before any of this: **Is your outcome goal specific enough?**

If 50 ideas all plausibly connect to your outcome, the outcome might be too broad. "Increase engagement" spawns infinite ideas. "Increase 7-day retention for users who complete onboarding" is much more constraining.

Would you like help structuring the prioritization session or defining sharper outcome criteria?

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me build an Opportunity Solution Tree. Our outcome is 'increase trial-to-paid conversion by 20%'. What opportunities should we explore, and how do I structure the tree?
```

Response:

```
Now I have what I need to help you build your OST. Here's how to structure it for your outcome:

---

## Your Opportunity Solution Tree

### Outcome (top of tree)
**Increase trial-to-paid conversion by 20%**

This is a good outcome — it's measurable and focused on customer behavior change.

### Step 1: Map the Trial Experience

Before listing opportunities, frame them around the customer journey during trial. This becomes your top-level structure:

```
Trial Journey Stages:
1. First visit / signup
2. Initial exploration  
3. First meaningful use (activation)
4. Continued use during trial
5. Conversion decision moment
6. Post-decision (churned trials)
```

### Step 2: Opportunities to Explore

**Critical point:** These must be customer needs/pains, NOT features. Here's a starter tree — but you need customer interviews to validate and expand these:

```
Outcome: Increase trial-to-paid conversion by 20%

├── Activation (first meaningful use)
│   ├── I don't understand what to do first
│   │   ├── There's no clear starting point
│   │   └── I'm overwhelmed by options
│   ├── Setup takes too long before I see value
│   │   ├── I have to configure things I don't understand
│   │   └── I can't skip steps that don't apply to me
│   └── I can't tell if this is working
│       ├── No feedback that I did it right
│       └── Results don't appear immediately
│
├── Value realization during trial
│   ├── I haven't experienced the core benefit yet
│   │   ├── I'm using features but missing the main value
│   │   └── I don't know what "success" looks like here
│   ├── I forget to come back
│   │   └── Nothing reminds me to continue
│   └── I hit a wall and got stuck
│       ├── Help isn't available when I need it
│       └── I don't know what I don't know
│
├── Conversion decision
│   ├── I'm not sure the price is worth it
│   │   ├── I can't quantify the value I received
│   │   └── I don't know what I'd lose if I stopped
│   ├── I need someone else to approve
│   │   ├── I can't explain the value to my boss
│   │   └── No easy way to share what I built
│   └── I'm not ready to commit yet
│       ├── Trial ended before I finished evaluating
│       └── I haven't tried the thing I signed up for
│
└── Churned trials (why they left)
    ├── This doesn't solve my actual problem
    │   └── I thought it did X but it does Y
    ├── Too complicated for my needs
    │   └── I need something simpler
    └── I found something better
        └── Competitor does the key thing faster/cheaper
```

### Step 3: What You Must Do Next

**You cannot complete this tree from a conference room.** The opportunities above are hypotheses. To make them real:

1. **Interview 5-10 recent trial users** — both converters and churners
2. **Ask for stories, not opinions:**
   - "Tell me about when you signed up. What were you trying to do?"
   - "Walk me through your first session. What happened?"
   - "At what point did you decide to pay / not pay?"
3. **Listen for signals:**
   - "I gave up when..." (friction)
   - "I didn't realize..." (confusion)
   - "I wish I could..." (unmet need)
   - "I kept coming back because..." (value moment)

### Step 4: After Interviews, Pick ONE Branch

Don't try to solve everything. Pick the opportunity branch where:
- You hear the same pain from multiple users
- Solving it clearly connects to conversion
- You can address it this quarter

Then generate **at least 3 solutions** for that opportunity before choosing one.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Writing solutions as opportunities | "Add onboarding wizard" | Reframe: "I don't know what to do first" |
| Opportunities too broad | "Make trial easier" | Decompose: What specific moment is hard? |
| Flat list instead of tree | 15 bullets at one level | Nest: Which pains are children of others? |
| No customer input | "We think users want..." | Interview: Get stories from real trial users |
