Prompt:

```
How do I figure out pricing for a new product? Walk me through the process.
```

Response:

```
This is a great question for the **Monetizing Innovation** framework (based on the book by Madhavan Ramanathan and Georg Tacke from Simon-Kucher). Let me walk you through the process.

## The Core Insight: Price Before You Build

Most companies design a product, then figure out what to charge. This is backwards. **72% of new products fail to meet revenue targets** because pricing comes too late.

The right approach: determine willingness to pay *during* product development, then design to a price point.

## Step-by-Step Pricing Process

### 1. Talk to Customers About Value (Not Price)

Don't ask "What would you pay?" — customers will lowball you. Instead:

**Ask about the problem:**
- "What does this problem cost you today?"
- "What are you doing now to solve it?"
- "What would it be worth to make this problem go away?"

**Ask about alternatives:**
- "What would you use if our product didn't exist?"
- "What do you pay for that?"

### 2. Identify Your Value Metric

The unit you charge on should scale with the value customers receive:

| Product Type | Bad Metric | Better Metric |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Analytics tool | Per seat | Per data volume or insights generated |
| Scheduling app | Flat fee | Per booking or appointment |
| API service | Per seat | Per API call or transaction |

**Test:** If a customer uses 10x more, do they get ~10x more value? If yes, they should pay ~10x more.

### 3. Segment by Willingness to Pay

Not all customers value your product equally. Create tiers based on:

- **Features they need** (not features you want to upsell)
- **Scale of their problem** (enterprise vs SMB)
- **Sophistication** (self-serve vs high-touch)

A good structure: 3 tiers maximum, with clear "why would I upgrade?" logic.

### 4. Find Price Thresholds

Customers have psychological boundaries. Common techniques:

**The Van Westendorp questions:**
1. At what price is this too cheap (you'd question quality)?
2. At what price is this a bargain?
3. At what price is this getting expensive but still worth it?
4. At what price is this too expensive?

The overlap between "bargain" and "expensive" is your acceptable range.

### 5. Test Before Launch

- **A/B test pricing pages** if you can
- **Run pilots with committed customers** — not just interested ones
- **Get signed LOIs** at specific price points before building

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Cost-plus pricing** — Your costs are irrelevant to customer value
2. **Matching competitors** — You're not selling the same thing
3. **Discounting to close** — Trains customers to wait for discounts
4. **One price fits all** — Leaves money on the table and prices out good customers
5. **Pricing after building** — Too late to change the product

---

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Talked to 10+ potential customers about the problem's cost
- [ ] Identified what they use today and what they pay
- [ ] Chosen a value metric that scales with customer benefit
- [ ] Defined 2-3 segments with different willingness to pay
- [ ] Tested price thresholds with direct questions
- [ ] Have at least one customer willing to pay before building

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We're launching a new tier of our SaaS product. Leadership wants to price it at $99/month but I think that's too low. How do I validate willingness to pay before we launch?
```

Response:

```
This is a great question about pricing validation. Based on the **Monetizing Innovation** framework (from Madhavan Ramanujam's work), here's how to validate willingness to pay before launch:

## Key Principle: Have the Pricing Conversation Early

The biggest mistake is treating pricing as an afterthought. You should validate willingness to pay *during* development, not after.

## Practical Validation Approaches

### 1. Direct WTP Questions (Do This Now)
Ask potential customers directly, but frame it correctly:

**Don't ask:** "What would you pay for this?"
*(People lowball or give meaningless answers)*

**Do ask:**
- "At what price would this be so expensive you wouldn't consider it?"
- "At what price would this be so cheap you'd question the quality?"
- "At what price would this be getting expensive but still worth considering?"
- "At what price would this be a great deal?"

This is the **Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter** — it gives you a range, not a single misleading number.

### 2. Test for Price Thresholds
$99 vs $149 vs $199 aren't just numbers — they cross psychological thresholds. Test whether crossing from two digits to three ($99 → $100+) materially changes purchase intent.

### 3. Segment Before You Price
Different customers have different WTP. Ask:
- What's the customer's alternative today? (That's your price anchor)
- What value does this unlock for them specifically?
- Are there segments who would pay 2-3x more for the same thing?

### 4. Look for Buying Signals
If prospects say things like "that's it?" or immediately agree to $99 without negotiation — you've underpriced.

## Your Situation

If you believe $99 is too low, gather evidence:
1. Run 5-10 customer conversations using the questions above
2. Calculate the economic value your tier creates (time saved × hourly rate, revenue enabled, etc.)
3. Compare to what they pay for alternatives

If the value delivered is worth $500/month to customers and you're charging $99, you're leaving money on the table *and* signaling lower quality.

Would you like help structuring these validation conversations, or working through the value-based pricing calculation?

### application

Prompt:

```
Apply the Monetizing Innovation framework to our API product. We're not sure if we should charge per seat, per API call, or flat rate. How do I think through this?
```

Response:

```
## How to Think Through Your API Pricing Model

The framework says **how you charge matters more than how much**. Here's how to decide between per-seat, per-API-call, and flat rate:

### Step 1: Match the Metric to Customer-Perceived Value

Ask yourself: **What does the customer actually care about?**

| Model | Works When | Fails When |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| **Per seat** | Value comes from collaboration, every user gets ongoing value | Usage varies wildly per user, or non-users still benefit |
| **Per API call** | Customers understand and can predict their usage, and more calls = more value for them | Your buyers don't know what an API call is, or heavy use doesn't mean more business value |
| **Flat rate** | Usage is consistent, you want simple sales conversations | You have a wide range of customer sizes with different needs/WTP |

The Segment example is instructive: they switched FROM per-API-call (technical, unpredictable) TO "monthly tracked users" (business metric customers already care about). **Your metric should be something your buyer already tracks.**

### Step 2: Answer These Questions

1. **Who is the buyer?** If it's a developer, they might understand API calls. If it's a business person, they probably don't.

2. **Does more usage = more value for the customer?** If a customer making 10x more API calls is getting 10x more business value, usage-based works. If they're just hitting your API inefficiently, they'll feel punished.

3. **Can customers predict their costs?** Unpredictable bills kill retention. If usage is spiky, consider a hybrid (base subscription + overage).

4. **What's your usage variability?** 
   - Low variability → flat rate or per-seat works fine
   - High variability → usage-based captures value from heavy users

5. **Is there a business outcome you can tie to?** The highest pricing power comes from outcome-based pricing (e.g., "$0.99 per resolution" like Intercom Fin). Can you charge per ticket resolved, per insight generated, per task completed?

### Step 3: Consider Hybrid Models

Pure models often fail. Consider:

- **Base + overage**: $X/month includes Y calls, then $Z per additional call
- **Tiered usage bands**: 0-10K calls = $50, 10K-100K = $200, etc.
- **Seat + usage credits**: Per-seat base, but heavy AI/compute usage burns credits

### Step 4: Talk to Customers (The Right Way)

**Don't ask:** "Would you prefer per-seat or per-call pricing?"

**Do ask:**
- "How do you budget for tools like this today?"
- "If this tool saves you X hours/week, how much would that be worth?"
- "What would make you nervous about your bill each month?"
- "How would you explain the cost to your CFO?"

### The Decision Framework

```
                    CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS USAGE
                              │
     PER-SEAT                 │      PER-API-CALL
     (if value is per-user)   │      (if more calls = more value)
                              │
LOW USAGE VARIABILITY ────────┼──────── HIGH USAGE VARIABILITY
                              │
     FLAT RATE                │      HYBRID
     (simple, predictable)    │      (base + overage)
                              │
                    CUSTOMER CAN'T PREDICT USAGE
```

### My Recommendation

For an API product, **start with hybrid**: a base subscription that includes a generous amount of usage, with per-call pricing for overages. This gives:

- Predictable revenue for you
- Predictable costs for most customers
- Fair capture of value from heavy users
- A natural expansion path as customers grow

Then validate this with 10-20 customer conversations before committing.

What does your customer base look like — developers building on top of you, or business users consuming output?
