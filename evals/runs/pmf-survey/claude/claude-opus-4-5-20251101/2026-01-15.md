# Measuring Product-Market Fit with the PMF Survey

The **Sean Ellis PMF Survey** is the most widely-used quantitative method for measuring product-market fit. It's simple: ask users how they'd feel if they could no longer use your product.

## The Core Question

> "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
> - Very disappointed
> - Somewhat disappointed  
> - Not disappointed

**The benchmark**: If **40%+ of users say "very disappointed"**, you likely have product-market fit.

## Why This Works

The question measures **dependency**, not satisfaction. Users can like a product but not need it. "Very disappointed" signals the product has become essential to how they work or live.

## How to Run It

### 1. Who to Survey
- Users who've experienced the core value (not day-1 signups)
- People who've used it at least 2-3 times in the last few weeks
- Exclude churned users—you want to measure current fit, not diagnose churn

### 2. Essential Follow-up Questions

```
1. How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?
   [ ] Very disappointed
   [ ] Somewhat disappointed
   [ ] Not disappointed

2. What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?
   [Open text]

3. What type of person do you think would benefit most from [product]?
   [Open text]

4. How can we improve [product] for you?
   [Open text]
```

### 3. Sample Size
- Minimum 40 responses for directional signal
- 100+ for statistical confidence
- Segment if you have enough volume

## Interpreting Results

| Score | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| **40%+** | Strong PMF signal—double down on what's working |
| **25-40%** | Promising but not there—segment to find your HXC |
| **<25%** | Weak fit—pivot or narrow your focus |

## The Real Power: Segmentation

Raw scores lie. A 30% overall might hide a 60% segment.

**Segment by:**
- Use case (what they use it for)
- Company size or role
- Acquisition channel
- Main benefit they wrote

Find the segment where you're already winning, then focus everything on them.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Surveying too early** — Users need time to experience value
2. **Ignoring "somewhat disappointed"** — These users tell you what's missing
3. **Treating 40% as binary** — It's a signal, not a certification
4. **Not reading the open-ended responses** — The "main benefit" question tells you your actual positioning

### scenario

Prompt:

```
Investors keep asking if we have product-market fit. Some users love us, others churn immediately. I need a concrete way to measure where we are and track progress.
```

Response:

```
Based on your situation, I recommend using the **PMF Survey** framework (Sean Ellis method). Let me pull up the skill and give you a concrete measurement approach.

## Quick Assessment

The core question to ask your users:

> **"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"**
> - Very disappointed
> - Somewhat disappointed  
> - Not disappointed

**The benchmark**: If 40%+ of users say "very disappointed," you likely have PMF. Below 40%, you're still searching.

## Your Situation Sounds Like a Segmentation Problem

"Some users love us, others churn immediately" is actually a good sign—it suggests you have PMF with a *subset* of users. The key is identifying that subset.

### Immediate Action Plan

**1. Run the survey now** (need 40+ responses minimum)

Add these follow-up questions:
- "What type of person do you think would benefit most from [product]?" (reveals your HXC)
- "What is the main benefit you receive?" (shows what's actually working)
- "How can we improve for you?" (different answers by segment)

**2. Segment your results**

Don't look at the aggregate score—break it down:
- By acquisition channel
- By use case / job-to-be-done
- By company size or persona
- By feature usage patterns

You'll likely find one segment at 50%+ "very disappointed" and others at 10%.

**3. For investors, present it as:**

> "We've achieved PMF with [specific segment]—X% would be very disappointed without us. We're now focused on deepening that segment before expanding."

This is actually a stronger story than vague "users love us" claims.

## Red Flags to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Hurts |
|---------|--------------|
| Surveying everyone who signed up | Includes people who never activated—survey active users |
| Looking only at aggregate score | Hides that you may have PMF with a segment |
| Treating "somewhat disappointed" as positive | It's not—these users will churn for a better option |
| Running once and stopping | Track monthly to show trajectory |

## What Good Looks Like

**Slack's early data** (example): 
- Overall: ~35% very disappointed
- Teams using 2000+ messages: 65% very disappointed
- Their move: Focus entirely on high-usage teams

**Your version**: Find your "2000+ messages" equivalent—the behavior that correlates with love.

# Running a PMF Survey

Based on the PMF Survey skill, here's what you need:

## The Question

Ask your active users:

> **"How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"**
> - Very disappointed
> - Somewhat disappointed
> - Not disappointed (it isn't really that useful)

This is the Sean Ellis test, specifically designed to measure product-market fit.

## Who to Survey

From your 500 active users, target people who:
- Have used your product **at least twice**
- Used it **within the last 2 weeks**
- Have experienced the **core value** (not just signed up)

Don't survey churned users or people who signed up but never activated. You want to measure fit among people who've actually experienced the product.

**Sample size**: 40-50 responses is enough to get a reliable signal. With 500 active users, aim for a 10-20% response rate.

## The Benchmark

**40% "Very disappointed" = Product-Market Fit**

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| <25% | Weak fit — major pivots likely needed |
| 25-40% | Promising — double down on what's working |
| 40%+ | Strong fit — focus on growth |

## Interpreting Results

**If you hit 40%+**: Identify your "very disappointed" users. What do they have in common? Double down on that segment.

**If you're below 40%**: 
1. Segment responses by user type, use case, or acquisition channel
2. Look for any segment where "very disappointed" is higher
3. Focus on that segment — you may have fit with a subset

## Add These Follow-Up Questions

To make results actionable, include:

1. **"What would you likely use as an alternative?"** (reveals true competitors)
2. **"What is the main benefit you receive?"** (in their words)
3. **"How can we improve [product] for you?"** (filter by response type)

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Survey active users only (used 2+ times, recently)
- [ ] Use exact wording of the question
- [ ] Collect 40-50+ responses minimum
- [ ] Segment results before acting
- [ ] Focus on "very disappointed" users — they're your champions
