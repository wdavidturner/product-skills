Prompt:

```
What are the 7 Powers? How do I use them to evaluate competitive moats?
```

Response:

```
The **Seven Powers** framework, developed by Hamilton Helmer, identifies the only sources of durable competitive advantage that lead to persistent differential returns. A "Power" must provide both a **benefit** (superior economics) and a **barrier** (that prevents competitors from arbitraging away that benefit).

## The Seven Powers

| Power | Benefit | Barrier |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Scale Economies** | Lower unit costs as volume increases | Prohibitive catch-up costs for smaller players |
| **Network Effects** | Value increases as more users join | New entrants start with zero users |
| **Counter-Positioning** | Superior business model incumbents can't copy | Copying would damage incumbent's existing business |
| **Switching Costs** | Can charge more; retain customers | Customers face real costs to leave |
| **Branding** | Price premium and/or lower customer acquisition | Takes years and sustained investment to build |
| **Cornered Resource** | Exclusive access to valuable input | Resource isn't available to competitors |
| **Process Power** | Lower costs or better quality from embedded processes | Processes are opaque and take years to develop |

## How to Evaluate Competitive Moats

**Step 1: Identify the claimed Power**

Ask: "What specific Power does this company have?" Vague answers like "great team" or "first mover" aren't Powers.

**Step 2: Verify the Benefit exists**

- Is there measurable superior profitability, pricing power, or cost advantage?
- Can you quantify it? (e.g., "40% lower CAC than competitors")

**Step 3: Verify the Barrier is real**

- What specifically prevents a well-funded competitor from replicating this?
- Has it actually stopped competitors, or do they just not exist yet?

**Step 4: Check timing**

Different Powers emerge at different stages:
- **Origination** (before takeoff): Counter-Positioning, Cornered Resource
- **Takeoff** (rapid growth): Network Effects, Scale Economies, Switching Costs
- **Stability** (mature): Branding, Process Power

## Common Evaluation Mistakes

- **Confusing operational excellence with Power** — Being "better at execution" isn't a Power unless it's Process Power (opaque, embedded, years to replicate)
- **Claiming Network Effects without network economics** — Having many users isn't the same as each user making the product more valuable for others
- **Mistaking brand recognition for Branding Power** — True Branding means customers pay more or choose you *even when informed* of alternatives

## Quick Moat Test

For any business, ask:

1. Which specific Power do they claim?
2. What's the quantified Benefit?
3. What's the specific Barrier that stops competitors?
4. Is the timing right for this Power to emerge?

If you can't answer all four concretely, the moat may not exist.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We're growing fast but I'm worried competitors will just copy us. How do I think about building defensibility? What actually creates a sustainable moat?
```

Response:

```
Here's the honest answer on defensibility:

## The Core Insight: Power = Benefit + Barrier

Most "competitive advantages" aren't actually defensible. Ask two questions:
1. **Benefit:** Does this create materially lower costs OR higher prices?
2. **Barrier:** What *prevents* competitors from copying it?

If you can't answer both, you don't have a moat. You're running on a treadmill.

---

## The 7 Powers (What Actually Creates Moats)

| Power | Benefit | Barrier | When Available |
|-------|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Counter-Positioning** | Superior business model | Copying would damage incumbent's core business | Early stage |
| **Scale Economies** | Lower unit costs at volume | Competitors can't match without first achieving scale | Takeoff |
| **Network Economies** | Value increases with users | New entrants start at zero | Takeoff |
| **Switching Costs** | Retention + pricing power | Competitors must overcome lock-in | Takeoff |
| **Branding** | Price premium | Takes years/decades to build | Late stage |
| **Process Power** | Inimitable operations | So complex it can't be copied | Late stage |
| **Cornered Resource** | Exclusive asset value | Legal/contractual protection | Anytime (rare) |

---

## What's Probably NOT a Moat

**"We have the best team"** — They can be hired away. Operational excellence, not power.

**"We move faster"** — So can competitors when motivated. Treadmill.

**"We have more data"** — Data advantages flatten quickly. If competitors have "enough," more doesn't help.

**"People know our brand"** — Brand *recognition* can be bought. Brand *power* (paying more for identical product) takes decades.

**"We have network effects"** — Network effects ≠ network economies. Uber and Lyft both have network effects. Neither has material network economies—that's why they compete fiercely on price.

---

## For Your Stage (Growing Fast)

Since you're growing fast, you're likely in the **takeoff phase**. Focus on:

1. **Counter-Positioning** (if still early): What would an incumbent have to give up to copy you? If copying hurts their core business, you have breathing room.

2. **Building toward scale/network/switching**: Which of these could your business develop?
   - Do your unit costs drop meaningfully with volume? (Scale)
   - Does each user make the product more valuable for others? (Network)
   - Do customers accumulate value that's hard to migrate? (Switching costs)

3. **Win the market share battle**: Powers like scale and network economies only accrue to the leader. Second place often gets nothing.

---

## The Honest Test

For whatever you think is your moat, answer:
- Can a well-funded competitor copy this in 18 months?
- If yes, it's not a moat—it's a head start.

The uncomfortable truth: many fast-growing companies don't have power yet. They have product-market fit and operational excellence. That's valuable, but not durable.

**What to do:** Identify which power your business *could* develop, then make strategic choices that tilt toward it.

### application

Prompt:

```
Apply the 7 Powers framework to our business. We're a vertical SaaS for dentists with 30% market share. Which powers do we have, and which should we build?
```

Response:

```
Now I have the full framework. Let me analyze your dental vertical SaaS through the 7 Powers lens.

## 7 Powers Analysis: Dental Vertical SaaS (30% Market Share)

### Your Current Stage: **Late Takeoff / Early Stability**

With 30% market share in a vertical SaaS, you've won the origination phase. You're now in the market share battle that determines which powers solidify.

---

## Power Assessment

### Powers You Likely Have

| Power | Assessment | Strength |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Switching Costs** | **Strong** | Dental practices embed your software into daily workflows — patient records, scheduling, billing, insurance claims. Migration is painful. |
| **Scale Economies** | **Moderate** | R&D costs spread across 30% of the market. But the curve flattens — a competitor with 15% share may have "good enough" unit economics. |

**Switching Costs** are your primary power right now:
- **Benefit:** Higher retention, pricing power with existing customers
- **Barrier:** Data migration, staff retraining, workflow disruption, integration rebuilding

But test durability: Are there data portability regulations coming? Are competitors building migration tools? If so, this erodes.

---

### Powers You Probably Don't Have (But Might Think You Do)

| Claimed Advantage | Reality Check |
|------------------|---------------|
| "Best product/UX" | Operational excellence, not power. Competitors can match it. |
| "Most dental data" | Data advantages flatten. A competitor with 100K practices has "enough" data. Do you have 10x better outcomes from 10x more data? Probably not. |
| "Dental industry expertise" | Unless your team *cannot* be recruited away, this isn't cornered. |
| "Brand recognition" | Dentists know your name. But would they pay 20% more for identical software? That's the branding test. |

---

### Powers Worth Building

#### 1. **Network Economies** — Most Promising

The question: Can you create value that increases with users?

**Opportunities:**
- **Referral networks:** Specialists ↔ general dentists. If your platform facilitates referrals, more dentists = more valuable network.
- **Supply purchasing:** Aggregate purchasing power across practices to negotiate better rates with suppliers. This only works at scale.
- **Benchmarking data:** "How does your practice compare to 50,000 others?" Meaningless with 1,000 practices.
- **Insurance network leverage:** If you're the platform insurers integrate with, every new insurer integration makes you more valuable to dentists.

**The test:** Does having 30% market share make your product *materially* more valuable than a competitor with 10%? If yes, you have network economies. If "somewhat better," you don't.

#### 2. **Counter-Positioning** — Fading Window

At 30% share, your counter-positioning window against legacy incumbents is closing. But consider:

- Are there incumbents in adjacent spaces (medical EMRs, practice management from other verticals) who would have to cannibalize themselves to compete?
- Can you adopt a model (pure cloud, AI-first, etc.) that legacy vendors can't match without destroying their services/implementation revenue?

#### 3. **Process Power** — Long Game

This takes years and is rare. But vertical SaaS is one place it can emerge:

- Deep domain expertise embedded in product decisions
- Implementation playbooks refined over thousands of deployments
- Customer success processes that can't be documented

**Heuristic:** If a consultant could teach your processes to a competitor in 6 months, it's not process power.

---

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Defend Current Position)
1. **Fortify switching costs** — Deepen integrations, make data exports painful (ethically), embed in workflows
2. **Win the scale battle** — 30% → 40%+ gives you meaningful cost advantages in R&D and support

### Medium-term (Build New Power)
3. **Test network economy opportunities** — Pick one (referrals, purchasing, benchmarks) and validate whether scale creates material value differential
4. **Lock in cornered resources if available** — Exclusive content partnerships, key talent with equity/non-competes, unique data relationships

### What NOT to Do
- Don't confuse "having data" with having power
- Don't assume brand recognition is branding power
- Don't invest heavily in operational excellence thinking it creates a moat (it doesn't — but you still have to do it)

---

## The Honest Assessment

**You have one real power:** Switching Costs (strong, but watch for erosion)

**You have one potential power:** Scale Economies (moderate, but curve is flattening)

**Your best opportunity:** Network Economies — but you need to build it deliberately. It won't emerge naturally.

**The risk:** At 30% share, you're large enough that competitors will invest to compete. Your switching costs buy you time, but they're a defensive moat, not an offensive weapon. The question is whether you can build a second power (likely network economies) before the market matures and switching costs become your only differentiator.
