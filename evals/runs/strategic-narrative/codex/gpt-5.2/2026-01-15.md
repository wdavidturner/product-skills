Prompt:

```
What is a strategic narrative and how do I create one for my company?
```

Response:

```
A strategic narrative is a clear, motivating “story of the strategy” that explains (1) what’s changing in the world, (2) what problem that creates for your customers, (3) why your company is uniquely positioned to solve it, and (4) the few choices you’ll make to win. It’s not a slogan or a pitch deck—it's the throughline that aligns teams, guides prioritization, and makes your strategy easy to repeat.

**How to create one**
- Start with inputs: customer pains (real quotes), market shift(s), your unfair advantages (data, distribution, expertise), and the strategic choices you’re already making (or avoiding).
- Write the narrative as a cause→effect arc: “Because X is changing, customers now struggle with Y; current solutions fail because Z; we believe A; so we will do B (and not do C); we’ll know we’re winning when D happens.”
- Make the strategy explicit: 2–4 “bets” (where you’ll invest), 2–4 “non-bets” (tradeoffs), and the capabilities you must build (e.g., speed, trust, cost, workflow depth).
- Add proof and specificity: a wedge use case, why now, what you’ve learned, early traction, or credible reasons you can execute.
- Tailor the “so what” by audience: what it means for customers, for product roadmap, for sales motion, for hiring, for partners.

**Practical template (1 page)**
- The shift: “The world is moving from ___ to ___.”
- The customer pain: “For ___, this creates ___ (cost/risk/time).”
- The failure of status quo: “Today’s options don’t work because ___.”
- Our belief: “We believe ___.”
- Our approach: “We will win by ___ (distinct mechanism).”
- Our choices: “We will focus on ___; we will not ___.”
- What we build: “Key pillars/capabilities: ___, ___, ___.”
- What success looks like: “In 12–24 months, we’ll see ___ (outcomes/metrics).”
- Call to action: “Therefore, our priorities this quarter are ___.”

If you share your company’s industry, target customer, and the main “shift” you think matters, I can help you draft a first narrative in that format.

What is a strategic narrative and how do I create one for my company?

**Defining strategic narrative**

I see that the user is asking a conceptual question rather than something technical. I need to provide a clear explanation with a step-by-step framework that’s concise but still thorough. I should outline the definition of a strategic narrative as a coherent story that explains a company's purpose, direction, and competitive advantage. It aligns stakeholders and guides decision-making. Including its components, processes, templates, and examples is essential. I might want to end with a couple of clarifying questions for the user, just to ensure I’ve addressed their needs!
thinking
**Crafting a strategic narrative**

I want to clarify that the strategic narrative should be distinct from a pitch or a brand story. Key elements include context, mission, vision, challenges, unique approaches, and proof of concepts. The process involves gathering inputs like customer insights and defining a core strategy, followed by crafting a story arc that outlines changes, customer struggles, and our beliefs. The output can range from a one-page narrative to a 30-second or 2-minute summary, and I should include validation methods and common pitfalls to consider.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
Our sales pitch is a feature list and it's not working. Prospects don't get why we're different. How do I tell a story that makes them care?
```

Response:

```
Stop leading with *what it is* (features) and lead with *what life is like before vs. after* (a change the buyer wants). A story that makes prospects care usually has this shape:

- **Pick a specific hero + moment:** “VP Sales at a 50–200 person SaaS, pipeline is fine, close rate is slipping.” If you can’t name the hero, you’ll default to a feature list.
- **Describe the “before” world vividly:** the messy workflow, the friction, and the emotional reality (stress, missed targets, internal blame).
- **Quantify the stakes of staying the same:** money, time, risk, and career impact. (“We lose X deals/month, reps waste Y hours, forecast misses create Z fire drills.”)
- **Name the *real* enemy:** not “spreadsheets,” but the underlying constraint (e.g., “decisions made on stale, partial signals” or “handoffs destroy context”). This is where differentiation lives.
- **Introduce your “new way” (the mechanism):** one clear insight that flips the approach (“Instead of logging activity, we capture buying signals automatically and guide next best action.”). Features only show up as *proof* of the mechanism.
- **Prove it with one credible example:** a short customer mini-story + metric + time-to-value (“In 3 weeks, ACME raised win rate 12% by…”) and an invitation to see it (“Want to see the 2 screens that make that happen?”).

A tight 60–90s pitch template you can fill in:
“Most **[hero]** try to **[common approach]**, but it breaks because **[enemy/constraint]**. The result is **[stakes quantified]**. We take a different approach: **[your mechanism]**. That means **[3 outcomes]**—without **[common tradeoff]**. For example, **[customer]** used it to **[metric]** in **[time]**. If that’s relevant, I can show you exactly how we **[key moment]** in 10 minutes.”

If you tell me your ICP, the “old way” you replace, and one measurable result customers get, I’ll draft a version tailored to your product (and a short talk track for discovery + demo).

thinking
**Giving storytelling advice**

The user needs concise, actionable guidance for storytelling. I want to focus on narrative structures, addressing the core problem, stakes, turning points, and differentiation. I might suggest frameworks like "Before/After/Bridge," "Hero's Journey," or the "3-act pitch." I should provide prompts and a sample template to help them create their story.

Also, outlining steps, I think it’s important to clarify the customer segment and their pain points. Finally, I should add examples for different time constraints like a 60-second version and a 5-minute version.
thinking
**Creating a tailored pitch**

I need to highlight the "why now" aspect for the user’s product. I want to craft six concise bullet points along with a mini script to emphasize this urgency. It feels important to ask for their specific product information so I can customize my advice to fit their needs perfectly. After all, making it specific will enhance the effectiveness of the message. I should keep the tone friendly and supportive throughout this process.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me write a strategic narrative using Andy Raskin's framework. We're a compliance automation tool. What's the shift in the world, and how do we frame our promised land?
```

Response:

```
**Shift In The World (Old Game → New Game)**  
- Compliance used to be a periodic, point-in-time event: prep for an audit, scramble for evidence, pass, repeat.  
- Now trust is continuous and buyer-driven: security reviews happen before deals close, regulators expand scope (privacy, cyber, operational resilience), and environments change daily (cloud, CI/CD, vendors).  
- The cost of the old approach is compounding: spreadsheet-based controls, screenshot evidence, and manual checklists can’t keep up with change velocity—so teams either slow the business down or accept invisible risk.  
- The “enemy” to name: the Audit Scramble—fragmented tools + manual evidence hunting + compliance-as-a-project.

**Promised Land (How To Frame It)**  
- Compliance becomes a living system, not a quarterly fire drill: evidence is captured automatically, controls are continuously tested, and gaps surface early.  
- You’re “always audit-ready”: audits become a verification step, not months of disruption.  
- Trust moves at the speed of the business: faster sales cycles, fewer security review back-and-forths, predictable certifications, lower risk.  
- Identity statement: “From compliance theater to provable trust.”

**Sample Strategic Narrative (Editable Copy)**  
A decade ago, compliance was something you did *to* satisfy an annual audit. You pulled screenshots, chased owners, and assembled a binder that represented a moment in time. But the world changed: infrastructure is dynamic, vendors are everywhere, and customers now demand proof of controls before they sign—while regulators expect continuous accountability. The old way creates an audit scramble that burns weeks, stalls revenue, and still leaves blind spots between audits. The new way is continuous compliance: controls tied to real systems, evidence collected automatically, and issues detected as they emerge. In that world, audits are no longer a disruption—they’re simply confirming what’s already true. Our promised land is provable trust on autopilot: always-ready compliance, faster deals, and fewer surprises.

If you tell me your primary buyer (security, compliance, GRC, founder) and your anchor framework (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.), I’ll tailor the “enemy” and promised-land language to match their urgency and KPIs.

thinking
**Drafting strategic narrative**

I need to focus on a concise approach for writing a strategic narrative based on Andy Raskin's framework. The user asked about the shift and promised land, so I’ll define the shift as moving from periodic, manual compliance to a continuous, automated system that supports real-time regulatory needs. The enemy here includes outdated tools and fragmented processes that create audit chaos. The promised land is a state of continuous compliance, lowering costs and reducing risk.

I'll structure my draft into two sections: "Shift in the world" and "Promised land framing," with a short sample narrative, keeping it under ten lines.
thinking
**Creating narrative elements**

The user is seeking help to write a concise narrative, focusing on key compliance standards like SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and GDPR. I need to include the demand from new buyers for early evidence and recent regulations like SEC cyber rules, DORA, and NIS2 without being too domain-specific. 

I can suggest options for regulated SaaS, fintech, and health sectors. My response will include bullet points and a draft narrative of 6-10 sentences. I’ll position compliance as a product rather than a project and introduce taglines like "from evidence hunting to evidence streaming."
