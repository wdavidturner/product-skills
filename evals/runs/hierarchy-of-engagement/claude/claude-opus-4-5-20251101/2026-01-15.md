### minimal

Prompt:

```
How do I identify and measure our product's core action?
```

Response:

```
A core action is the single behavior that correlates most strongly with long-term retention. Here's how to identify and measure yours:

## Identifying Your Core Action

**Start with retention curves.** Pull cohort data for users who retained at 30/60/90 days versus those who churned. Look for behaviors that differ dramatically between the two groups.

**Look for frequency, not just occurrence.** The core action isn't usually "signed up" or "completed onboarding" — it's a repeated behavior that compounds value.

**Examples by product type:**
- **Pinterest:** Pin an image (not just browse)
- **Slack:** Send messages in channels (not just read)
- **Spotify:** Add songs to playlists (not just listen)
- **Dropbox:** Save a file to a synced folder

## Common Mistakes

**Wrong: Choosing the most common action**
Page views or logins are high-frequency but don't predict retention.

**Wrong: Choosing what you want users to do**
Your desired behavior isn't necessarily what actually drives retention.

**Right: Let the data show you**
Run correlation analysis between early behaviors and 90-day retention. The action with the highest correlation coefficient is your candidate.

## Measurement Approach

1. **Define the action precisely** — "Created a board" vs "Created a board with 5+ pins"
2. **Set a timeframe** — Actions within first 7 days matter more than Day 30
3. **Track the threshold** — How many times must they do it? (Facebook's "7 friends in 10 days")
4. **Segment by acquisition channel** — Core action might vary by how users found you

## Validation Questions

- Do users who do this action retain at 2-3x the rate of those who don't?
- Is this action within your control to influence through product design?
- Does this action create stored value that increases switching costs?

If your core action doesn't load the next trigger (create a reason to return), you may have identified an outcome rather than a habit-forming behavior.
```


### scenario

Prompt:

```
We have lots of sign-ups but retention is terrible. Users try the product once and never come back. How do we figure out what's broken?
```

Response:

```
This is a classic activation and habit formation problem. Based on the patterns here, I'd approach it in three phases:

## 1. Diagnose: Why aren't they coming back?

**Run JTBD interviews with churned users** (not current users):
- Interview people who signed up, tried it once, and left
- Ask: "Walk me through what happened when you signed up. What were you trying to accomplish that day?"
- Don't ask "why did you leave?" — ask "what did you do instead?"

The goal is understanding the **job they hired you for** vs **what you actually delivered**. Often there's a mismatch.

**Check your PMF survey** on recent signups (before they churn):
- Ask: "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
- If <40% say "very disappointed," you have a value problem, not an activation problem
- Segment by the answer to "What type of person would benefit most?" — your HXC profile lives there

## 2. Map the gap: Activation vs Value

Use the **Hierarchy of Engagement** lens:

| Level | Question to answer |
|-------|-------------------|
| 1. Growing engaged users | Are users completing the core action at all? |
| 2. Retaining users | Does benefit accrue the more they use it? |
| 3. Self-perpetuating | Do they have mounting loss if they leave? |

**Common failure points:**
- **Wrong core action** — You're measuring signups or page views when the real value comes from a specific action (Pinterest needed *pins*, not visits)
- **No accruing benefit** — Each session starts from zero; there's no compounding value
- **No investment** — Users haven't put anything in that makes leaving costly

## 3. Apply the Hooked Model diagnostic

For each of these, rate yourself honestly:

| Component | Question | Red flag |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Trigger** | What brings them back? | Only external (emails, ads) — no internal trigger tied to an emotion/routine |
| **Action** | Is the core action easy enough? | Requires motivation; not simple enough to do on autopilot |
| **Variable Reward** | Is there something worth coming back for? | Reward is predictable or not tied to what they wanted |
| **Investment** | Did they put something in? | No data, customization, or social connections stored |

**The investment loads the next trigger.** If users aren't investing anything (data, preferences, connections), there's nothing pulling them back.

---

## Quick diagnostic questions

1. What's your "core action" — the single thing that delivers value? (Be specific)
2. How many users complete that action in session 1?
3. What happens in session 2 that's better because of session 1?
4. What would they lose if they stopped using the product today?

If you can't answer #3 and #4 clearly, that's likely your problem. Users aren't building anything worth returning to.
```


### application

Prompt:

```
Help me apply the Hierarchy of Engagement to our note-taking app. What should our core action be, and how do we build accruing benefits around it?
```

Response:

```
I'll load the Hierarchy of Engagement skill to give you a proper framework for this analysis.

## Applying Hierarchy of Engagement to Your Note-Taking App

### The Three Levels

1. **Growing engaged users** - Get users to complete a core action
2. **Retaining users** - Benefits accrue the more they use it
3. **Self-perpetuating** - Users create virtuous loops that bring them back

---

### Identifying Your Core Action

The core action must be **simple, repeatable, and directly tied to the product's value**. For a note-taking app, the obvious candidates:

| Candidate Action | Pros | Cons |
|------------------|------|------|
| **Create a note** | Very low friction | Too easy—doesn't create stickiness |
| **Save/organize a note** | Shows intent to return | Still passive |
| **Link notes together** | Creates network value | Too complex for new users |
| **Return to a note** | Proves ongoing value | Hard to measure intent |

**Recommendation: "Save a note to a workspace/folder"**

Why this over just "create a note":
- It signals **intent to return** (they're organizing for future use)
- It's the first step toward **accruing benefits** (the collection grows)
- It's simple enough for day-one activation

Pinterest's core action is "Pin" not "Browse"—saving shows commitment.

---

### Building Accruing Benefits (Level 2)

The key question: **Does the product get more valuable the more they use it?**

For note-taking, accruing benefits come from:

| Mechanism | How It Works | Implementation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Growing collection** | More notes = more personal value | Surface "You have X notes" milestones |
| **Better organization** | Tags/folders become a personal system | Show "Your most-used tags" |
| **Search becomes powerful** | More content = search is essential | Highlight "Found in 47 notes" |
| **Linked knowledge** | Connections between notes compound | Show backlinks, "Related notes" |

**The Evernote Trap to Avoid**: Evernote had accruing benefits (your notes lived there) but no **mounting loss**—exporting was easy, and the data wasn't interconnected enough to make leaving painful.

**Build mounting loss through:**
- Cross-note linking (leaving breaks your knowledge graph)
- Custom templates users create (effort they'd lose)
- Collaboration history (shared context with teammates)

---

### Creating Virtuous Loops (Level 3)

Self-perpetuating means **user actions create reasons to return**:

| Loop Type | Trigger | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Content loop** | Past notes pull you back | "Daily note" reminders, "On this day" |
| **Social loop** | Others' actions create notifications | Shared workspace activity |
| **Workflow loop** | Integrations create automatic value | Capture from other apps, daily digests |

**Most note-taking apps fail at Level 3** because notes are inherently solo. Your lever is either:
- **Collaboration** (Notion's path—shared workspaces create social loops)
- **Resurfacing** (Readwise's path—automatically remind users of past captures)

---

### Recommended Focus Order

1. **Nail Level 1 first**: What % of signups save 3+ notes in week one? Track this relentlessly.

2. **Build Level 2 around linked notes**: The more connections users create, the harder it is to leave. This is your moat.

3. **Level 3 via resurfacing**: Most users won't collaborate—but everyone benefits from being reminded of what they saved. Build "rediscovery" features.

---

### Metrics to Track

| Level | Metric | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | % users who save 3+ notes in week 1 | >40% |
| 2 | Avg notes per retained user at 90 days | >50 |
| 2 | % notes with 1+ link to other notes | >20% |
| 3 | % users returning from a notification/email | >15% |
