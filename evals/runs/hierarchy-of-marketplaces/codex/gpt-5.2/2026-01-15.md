### minimal

Prompt:

```
How do I solve the chicken-and-egg problem for a new marketplace?
```

Response:

```
Solve it by creating **real value for one side before the other side exists**, then narrowing to a tiny market where you can “look liquid,” and using temporary tactics (concierge, guarantees, subsidies) until organic loops take over.

- **Pick a side to seed first (usually the side with higher switching costs).**  
  - Seed **supply first** when quality/availability matters (services, rentals, labor).  
  - Seed **demand first** when supply is abundant/commoditized (used goods, local inventory).
- **Start with a wedge + tight scope (who/what/where).**  
  Make the initial market so small that 20–100 great listings or 50–200 motivated buyers creates the feeling of liquidity (one category, one neighborhood, one use case, one price band).
- **Provide “single‑player mode” value.**  
  Give a reason to join even if matching is scarce: tools (CRM, scheduling, payments), distribution (leads/SEO), analytics, insurance/verification, listings that syndicate elsewhere.
- **Manually create liquidity (concierge marketplace).**  
  Do outbound sourcing, curate inventory, and match by hand in the beginning. You’re buying learning and trust; automate only after you see repeatable patterns.
- **Use guarantees and asymmetric incentives.**  
  Reduce risk for the side you’re trying to activate: guaranteed minimum earnings, first-transaction bonuses, fee holidays, escrow, delivery/returns, dispute resolution.
- **Bring an “anchor” into the market.**  
  A large supplier, a major buyer, a community/association, or a platform partner that instantly supplies one side (even if it’s not exclusive).
- **Exploit existing networks instead of building from zero.**  
  Pull supply from offline rosters, Instagram/Shopify, Yelp/Google lists, distributors; pull demand from communities, newsletters, influencers, employer/HOA partnerships.
- **Create repeatable acquisition loops.**  
  Examples: listings → SEO → buyers → sellers invite peers; buyer referrals; supplier referrals; post-transaction reviews → conversion; reactivation via saved searches/alerts.
- **Measure “liquidity,” not just growth.**  
  Track time-to-first-match, search-to-fill rate, repeat rate, and % of users who successfully transact within a short window in your initial niche.

If you tell me the marketplace category, the two sides (e.g., “homeowners” vs “painters”), and your geography, I can suggest the best seeding order and a concrete 30-day launch plan.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We're building a marketplace connecting freelance designers with startups. We have neither supply nor demand yet. Where do we start?
```

Response:

```
Start by **choosing a narrow wedge where you can create liquidity fast**, then run a **manual (concierge) marketplace** until you have repeatable demand and reliable supply.

- Pick a specific buyer + job: e.g., “Seed–Series A B2B SaaS needing a landing page + pitch deck refresh in 7 days” (not “designers for startups”).
- Start with demand first (usually easier): interview 20–30 founders/PMMs, extract 1–2 recurring “pain + urgency + budget” jobs, and pre-sell 5–10 paid pilots.
- Define a productized offer: clear scope, timeline, price range, deliverables, revision policy, and a strong guarantee (“7-day delivery or refund/credit”).
- Fulfill manually: you (or a small team) match, scope, and QA; keep the “marketplace” as a landing page + Stripe + email/Slack at first.
- Recruit supply only for the sold jobs: source 20–50 designers from targeted communities, vet via paid test or portfolio rubric, and build a small “bench” of 5–10 reliable people.
- Create repeatability: templates for briefs, pricing, contracts, handoff, QA checklist, and a tight matching algorithm you run by hand.
- Measure the right signals: time-to-first-hire, fill rate, on-time delivery, buyer repeat rate, designer re-engagement, and gross margin after QA/ops.
- Expand only after pull: add adjacent jobs (brand sprint → website → ongoing design), then widen buyer segment or geography.

If you tell me your initial hypothesis (startup type, typical design request, budget range, and your unfair advantage—audience, network, brand, or expertise), I’ll help you pick the best wedge and a 2-week execution plan to get the first 5 transactions.

### application

Prompt:

```
Apply the Hierarchy of Marketplaces framework to our local services marketplace. We're at GMV level 1. What should we focus on to get to level 2?
```

Response:

```
In the **Hierarchy of Marketplaces**, moving from **GMV Level 1 → Level 2** is usually the shift from “we can generate transactions” to “transactions happen reliably and repeatedly without heroics.” For a local services marketplace, that means building a **dependable booking loop** in a tight wedge.

- **Win a wedge (one service × one geo × one customer type)**: concentrate demand and supply so availability feels “always on,” and you can iterate fast on the core workflow.
- **Fix liquidity reliability (not just more supply/demand)**: optimize for *fast response + high acceptance + low cancels/no-shows*. Put SLAs, incentives, and lightweight dispatch/routing in place until the market feels instant.
- **Productize the transaction end-to-end**: in-product quoting/pricing, scheduling, deposits/payments, cancellation policies, and post-job confirmation—reduce back-and-forth and off-platform leakage.
- **Standardize quality + trust**: vetting, reviews that matter (service-specific), guarantees/insurance, dispute handling, and provider coaching—reduce variance so buyers rebook confidently.
- **Create repeat behavior**: rebook flows, reminders, “same pro again,” service plans/subscriptions for recurring needs, and targeted lifecycle messaging after a successful job.

If you want one crisp Level 2 “definition” to aim at: **in your wedge, most requests get a booked appointment quickly, jobs complete with consistent quality, and a meaningful share of customers return without paid reacquisition.**
