Prompt:

```
How do I solve the chicken-and-egg problem for a new marketplace?
```

Response:

```
Based on the hierarchy-of-marketplaces skill, here's how to solve the chicken-and-egg problem:

## Core Strategy: Constrain to Win

The key insight is to **start small enough that you can manually create density**, then expand.

### 1. Pick a "Thimble, Not an Ocean"

Focus on a hyperlocal or niche segment where you can achieve liquidity fast:

- **Geographic**: Uber started in SF only, Airbnb in SF/NYC
- **Vertical**: Focus on one category (Etsy → handmade, not all commerce)
- **Use case**: Solve one job perfectly before expanding

### 2. Subsidize the Harder Side First

Identify which side is harder to attract, then:

- **Pay them directly**: Uber guaranteed driver earnings
- **Do the work yourself**: Airbnb founders photographed listings themselves
- **Aggregate existing supply**: Yelp scraped business data before restaurants joined

### 3. Create "Captive Supply"

Find supply that's already concentrated:
- Events (food trucks at a festival)
- Institutions (campus delivery → already have students)
- Existing communities (Etsy recruited from craft forums)

### 4. Single-Player Mode

Make one side valuable even without the other:
- OpenTable gave restaurants reservation software (useful alone)
- Yelp gave users reviews before restaurants participated

### 5. Sequence Your Expansion

Once you hit liquidity in thimble #1:
1. Prove unit economics work
2. Pick adjacent thimble with similar supply/demand dynamics
3. Repeat — don't spray geographically

## What NOT to Do

- **Launch nationally** — you'll be thin everywhere
- **Chase GMV over happiness** — focus on repeat rate and NPS first
- **Ignore the tipping point** — know what density looks like before scaling

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We're building a marketplace connecting freelance designers with startups. We have neither supply nor demand yet. Where do we start?
```

Response:

```
Start with **supply (designers)** first. Here's why and how:

## Why Supply First

Marketplaces face a chicken-and-egg problem, but it's not symmetric. For freelance designers:

1. **Supply is more patient than demand** — A designer who signs up and waits a week for their first job might stick around. A startup that posts a project and gets zero applicants churns immediately.

2. **You can manually fulfill demand** — With even 10 quality designers, you can personally match them to early clients. You can't fake supply.

3. **Supply quality defines your market position** — The designers you attract determine which startups will consider you.

## The Playbook

**Week 1-2: Get 10-20 designers manually**

- Pick a **specific niche** (e.g., "brand designers who've worked with Series A startups" or "product designers with SaaS experience")
- Recruit from Dribbble, Twitter/X, design Slack communities
- Offer something: portfolio visibility, early-adopter perks, or just personal connection
- **Interview each one** — you're also learning what designers actually want

**Week 3-4: Get your first 3-5 demand-side customers**

- Don't launch broadly. Find startups in your network
- **Do the matching yourself** — you're the algorithm
- Charge something (even $100) to ensure real intent
- Over-serve these clients: help them write briefs, facilitate communication

**What you're testing:**
- Can you find designers startups actually want to hire?
- What makes a project succeed vs fail on your platform?
- What's the repeat rate on both sides?

## Common Mistake: Geographic Spray

Don't try to be "a marketplace for designers" everywhere. Pick one city, one design discipline, or one startup stage. **Dominate a thimble before you try to fill an ocean.**

A 50% match rate in a tiny niche beats a 5% match rate across everything.
```


### application

Prompt:

```
Apply the Hierarchy of Marketplaces framework to our local services marketplace. We're at GMV level 1. What should we focus on to get to level 2?
```

Response:

```
I'll read the Hierarchy of Marketplaces skill to understand the framework and give you specific guidance.

**Hierarchy of Marketplaces Framework**

Based on Sarah Tavel's framework, here's where you are and what to focus on:

---

## Level 1: GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)
**Where you are now** — You're generating transactions. This is table stakes.

## Level 2: Happiness (Your Next Target)
**Focus: Supplier quality and match quality, not just more transactions**

---

## What to Focus On to Reach Level 2

### 1. Define and Measure "Happiness" for Both Sides

**For customers:**
- Did they complete the job successfully?
- Did they rebook the same provider?
- What's your NPS after transaction completion?

**For suppliers (service providers):**
- Are they getting enough work to stay engaged?
- What's their earnings trend over time?
- Are the jobs they're getting a good fit?

### 2. Build Happiness Loops, Not Just Growth Loops

The key insight: **GMV can grow while happiness stagnates**. You need loops that compound quality:

| Growth Loop (Level 1) | Happiness Loop (Level 2) |
|----------------------|-------------------------|
| More customers → more suppliers → more transactions | Better matches → higher completion → more reviews → better matches |
| Measures volume | Measures repeat rate and satisfaction |

**Action:** Track cohort repeat rates, not just total GMV. If customers aren't rebooking, you're churning through demand.

### 3. Fix the "Thimble Before the Ocean"

For local services, you likely need density in specific:
- **Geographies** — Better to dominate 3 zip codes than be thin across 30
- **Service categories** — Better to own plumbing than be mediocre at 10 trades

**Question to answer:** Where do you have enough supply density that customers get matched within 24 hours with a 4.5+ star provider?

### 4. Shift from GMV Metrics to Contribution Margin

At Level 2, start tracking:
- **Contribution profit per transaction** (not just GMV)
- **Customer acquisition cost payback** via repeat transactions
- **Supplier retention by earnings tier**

---

## Common Mistake to Avoid

Don't keep pouring money into customer acquisition if your repeat rate is low. That's a **leaky bucket** — you're at Level 1 forever.

**Signal you're ready for Level 2:** 
- Repeat rate > 30% within 90 days
- Supplier churn < 20% monthly for active providers
- Match success rate > 70% (customer accepts the provider offered)

---

## Immediate Actions

1. **Instrument happiness metrics** — You can't improve what you don't measure
2. **Interview churned customers** — Why didn't they come back?
3. **Interview churned suppliers** — Why did they stop accepting jobs?
4. **Pick one geography + one category** to get to happiness density first

Would you like me to dig into any of these areas — the happiness metrics to track, how to run the churn interviews, or the density analysis?
