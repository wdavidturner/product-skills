Prompt:

```
How do I write good OKRs? What makes them effective vs. useless?
```

Response:

```
Here's what makes OKRs effective vs. useless:

## The Core Formula

**One ambitious objective per quarter + 2-3 measurable key results + weekly check-ins**

That's it. Most OKR failures come from overcomplicating this.

## What Makes OKRs Effective

1. **Key Results are OUTCOMES, not tasks**
   - Bad: "Launch redesigned homepage"
   - Good: "Increase homepage-to-signup conversion from 2% to 4%"

2. **One objective, not five**
   - OKRs are about focus. If everything is a priority, nothing is.

3. **Objectives that inspire**
   - Should make you want to get out of bed
   - Bad: "Improve customer satisfaction"
   - Good: "Make customers love us so much they bring their friends"

4. **Weekly check-ins**
   - Set-and-forget kills OKRs. The cadence IS the system.
   - Monday: What will we do this week to move the key results?
   - Friday: What did we learn? What's the confidence level?

5. **Strategy exists FIRST**
   - OKRs don't replace strategy — they execute it. Without strategy, you're just setting random goals.

## What Makes OKRs Useless

- **Too many OKRs** — spreading focus defeats the purpose
- **Key results that are deliverables** — "Ship feature X" tells you nothing about impact
- **Fluffy objectives** — "Be more innovative" is meaningless
- **No weekly rhythm** — becomes a filing exercise
- **Using them for ALL work** — keep-the-lights-on tasks don't belong here
- **Sandbagging** — if you're hitting 100% every quarter, you're not stretching
- **Grading without learning** — the retrospective matters more than the score

## The Reality Check

OKRs are a **vitamin, not medicine**. They supercharge companies that already have:
- Clear strategy
- Empowered teams
- Psychological safety

They won't fix broken organizations — they'll just reveal what's broken.

Want me to show you specific pattern examples, or help you draft OKRs for something specific?

### scenario

Prompt:

```
Our team sets OKRs every quarter but they never feel meaningful. We either hit them easily or ignore them. How do we make OKRs actually drive behavior?
```

Response:

```
Your symptoms — "hit them easily or ignore them" — point to three specific problems:

## Why Your OKRs Aren't Driving Behavior

### 1. You're Probably Sandbagging
If you "hit them easily," your goals aren't stretching you. The right calibration:
- **Too easy:** You hit 100% and learned nothing
- **Sweet spot:** You hit 60-70% and learned a ton
- **Too hard:** You hit 30% and felt doomed from the start

**Fix:** Set goals that make you uncomfortable. If last quarter's retention was 42%, don't aim for 43% — aim for 55%. Even hitting 51% means you pushed harder than a safe target would have demanded.

### 2. You're Probably Setting Tasks, Not Outcomes
Check your key results. Are they things like:
- "Ship new onboarding flow by March 15"
- "Conduct 5 user interviews"
- "Launch email campaign"

Those are tasks. You can complete all of them and still fail. Real key results measure **what changes in the world**:
- "Increase Day-7 retention from 35% to 50%"
- "Reduce time-to-first-value from 3 days to 4 hours"

Outcome-based key results force you to keep iterating until something works.

### 3. You Almost Certainly Don't Have Weekly Check-ins
This is the killer. If OKRs only come up at kickoff and grading, they're PowerPoint theater.

**The cadence that works:**
- **Monday (15 min):** Confidence score (1-5) on each KR, top 3 priorities for the week, blockers
- **Friday (10 min):** Celebrate the week's wins

After a few weeks, you stop needing to look up your OKRs — they're just how you think about every decision.

---

**Quick diagnostic:** How often does your team discuss OKRs outside of planning/grading? If the answer is "rarely," that's your problem. The weekly rhythm is the system — the goal-setting is just setup.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me write OKRs for our growth team this quarter. Our focus is improving activation rate from 20% to 35%. What should the objective and key results look like?
```

Response:

```
Now I have what I need. Here's how to write effective OKRs for your growth team:

---

## Recommended OKRs for Growth Team

### Objective (inspiring, not boring)

**Don't write:** "Improve activation rate"

**Write:** "Create an activation experience so compelling that new users can't help but engage"

or

**"Turn signups into believers in their first session"**

The objective should make your team want to get out of bed. "Improve activation rate" reads like a metric—not a mission.

---

### Key Results (outcomes, not tasks)

**Don't write:**
1. Ship new onboarding flow
2. Run 5 experiments
3. Add in-app tooltips

**Write:**

| KR | Current | Target | Notes |
|----|---------|--------|-------|
| **KR1:** Activation rate | 20% | 35% | Your headline metric |
| **KR2:** Time-to-first-value | ? | Reduce by X% | How fast do users reach the "aha" moment? |
| **KR3:** Day-7 retention for activated users | ? | X% | Confirms activation actually sticks |

---

### Full Example

> **Objective:** Turn signups into believers in their first session
>
> **Key Results:**
> 1. Increase activation rate from 20% to 35%
> 2. Reduce median time-to-first-value from 48 hours to 8 hours
> 3. Improve Day-7 retention for activated users from 55% to 70%

---

## Why This Structure Works

1. **KR1** is your primary outcome (the goal you stated)
2. **KR2** measures HOW users get activated (speed matters—faster activation = less drop-off)
3. **KR3** validates the activation is real (users who "activate" but churn weren't truly activated)

This gives your team freedom to experiment with tactics (onboarding flows, emails, tooltips, whatever) while keeping focus on what actually matters: **did behavior change?**

---

## Quick Sanity Check

Before finalizing, ask:
- Could you complete all tasks (ship features, run experiments) and still fail these KRs? **Good—that's the point.**
- Does the objective inspire, or does it read like a Jira ticket?
- Do you have 2-3 key results, not 5-7?
- Are you committing to weekly check-ins on progress?

What's your current time-to-first-value and Day-7 retention? I can help you set appropriate targets for KR2 and KR3.
