Prompt:

```
Explain Jobs-to-be-Done and how to use it for product discovery.
```

Response:

```
Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a product discovery framework that focuses on the *progress* someone is trying to make in a situation, rather than who they are (personas) or what feature they asked for. People “hire” a product to get a job done; they “fire” it when it stops helping.

**Core Concepts**
- **Job**: The underlying goal (functional), plus **emotional** and **social** dimensions.
- **Situation + motivation**: Jobs are triggered by a circumstance; “why now?” matters.
- **Desired outcomes**: What “better” looks like (speed, certainty, effort, risk, quality).
- **Competing solutions**: The real competition is what they do today (spreadsheets, workarounds, doing nothing).

**How To Use JTBD For Product Discovery**
- **Pick a target moment**: Define the situation you care about (e.g., “when a team needs to onboard a new customer”).
- **Recruit by recent behavior**: Talk to people who *recently* did the thing (or tried and failed). Recency beats demographics.
- **Run “switch” interviews** (behavioral, not opinions):
  - Start with: “Tell me about the last time you…”
  - Walk the timeline: first thought → triggers → evaluation → decision → first use → ongoing use.
  - Probe constraints: time pressure, approvals, budget, risk, anxiety, tools already in place.
  - Capture “forces”: push from old way, pull to new way, habits, anxieties.
- **Synthesize into a Job Statement**:  
  - “When ___ (situation), I want to ___ (motivation/action), so I can ___ (desired outcome).”
- **Map the job journey**: Steps people go through (define, plan, execute, verify, maintain), and where they struggle.
- **Extract outcomes and pain points**: Turn quotes into measurable outcomes (“reduce time to…”, “increase confidence that…”).
- **Prioritize opportunities**:
  - High importance + low satisfaction outcomes are prime targets.
  - Also watch for high-frequency steps and high-risk moments.
- **Design and test concepts against the job**:
  - Prototype flows that reduce effort/risk and increase confidence at key moments.
  - Validate with: “Would this help you make progress in that situation?” and compare to their current workaround.
- **Translate into product decisions**:
  - Positioning: describe the situation and progress, not the feature list.
  - Roadmap: prioritize capabilities that unblock key steps/outcomes.

**Interview Prompts (Copy/Paste)**
- “What happened that made you start looking for something?”
- “What did you try first? Why?”
- “What was at stake if it didn’t work?”
- “What alternatives did you consider and reject?”
- “How did you decide it was ‘good enough’?”
- “What does success look like the next day/week/month?”

**Common Pitfalls**
- Asking hypotheticals (“Would you use…?”) instead of past behavior.
- Confusing **job** with **solution** (“I need a dashboard”)—keep drilling to the progress/outcome.
- Overfitting to a single “power user” workflow; validate across multiple recent cases.

If you tell me your product area and a representative user action (e.g., “teams create weekly reports”), I can help draft a job statement, an interview guide tailored to it, and an opportunity map.

**Explaining JTBD concepts**

The user wants an explanation without code changes, so I need to be concise yet informative. I should clarify what JTBD is, along with its core concepts and steps for product discovery. I can include an interview guide, relevant artifacts, and common pitfalls. A short template and example will be useful too, but I need to keep it structured within 10 lines, which seems manageable. I just have to avoid using any tools here.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We keep building features customers say they want, but adoption is low. I think we're missing something about why they actually buy. How do I figure out the real motivation?
```

Response:

```
Customers usually describe *solutions* (“we want feature X”), but they buy to make progress on an underlying “job” in a specific situation. To uncover the real motivation, do **switching/JTBD interviews** focused on the *last time they decided*.

- **Pick the right people:** 8–12 *recent buyers* (last 30–90 days), 6–10 *almost-bought / lost deals*, 6–10 *low-adoption accounts* (they paid but didn’t change behavior). Don’t interview “interested” users who never had urgency.
- **Run a “decision timeline” interview (30–45 min):** Walk chronologically from “normal life” → trigger → search → decision → first use. Your goal is *causality*, not feedback.
- **Ask questions that reveal motivation (verbatim prompts):**
  - “What was happening the week you started looking?”
  - “What made this a priority *now* (what broke / what changed)?”
  - “What did you try before us? Why wasn’t it good enough?”
  - “What were you afraid might go wrong if you chose wrong?”
  - “Who/what would have blocked the purchase? How did you get around it?”
  - “What does ‘success’ look like in 2 weeks / 2 months? How will you know?”
  - “If we disappeared tomorrow, what would you use instead?”
- **Synthesize with a simple forces map (per segment):**
  - Push (pain of current), Pull (dream outcome), Anxiety (risks), Habit (status quo), plus the *trigger event* and *required proof* to buy.
- **Separate “buying” from “adopting”:** For low adoption, add: “What did you expect to do first?” “Where did you get stuck?” “What workaround did you fall back to?” This exposes the missing workflow, not missing features.
- **Quantify after you learn the language:** Turn your top 5–8 motivations into a survey for a wider set (rank “top reason,” trigger events, switching alternatives). This prevents overfitting to anecdotes.
- **Validate with demand tests before building:** Run message tests (homepage/email), a “concierge” version of the promised outcome, or a paid pilot with a clear success metric—then build what repeatedly moves that metric.

If you tell me what you sell, who buys (role), and what “adoption is low” means (activation event + timeframe), I can help you draft a 10-question interview script and a one-page synthesis template tailored to your product.

**Planning a project analysis**

I’m thinking through a structured approach to analyze purchase decisions versus adoption. First, I want to define the outcome clearly. Then I'll select 10-15 recent buyers, 10 churned customers, and 10 prospects. Next, I’d run a JTBD "timeline" interview to gather insights, extract forces, and identify desired progress. I'll quantify findings with a survey, run demand tests, and adjust the roadmap to prioritize core workflow and time-to-value based on the data. Key questions will help guide this process!

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me prep for JTBD interviews. I'm talking to 10 recent customers this week. What questions should I ask to uncover their actual job-to-be-done?
```

Response:

```
Ask for a specific *past* buying/usage episode, then reconstruct the story end-to-end. Here’s a JTBD question set that reliably surfaces the real job, desired outcomes, and switching forces.

**1) Set the frame (2 min)**
- “I’m not testing you; I’m trying to understand what was going on in your world when you decided to try/buy this.”
- “Can we focus on the last time you decided to use/buy it (not hypotheticals)?”

**2) Establish the context + “struggle”**
- “What was happening in your work/life that made you start looking for something?”
- “What was the moment you realized, ‘I need to do something about this’?”
- “What were you trying to accomplish that day/week (bigger goal), and what was getting in the way?”
- “What are the consequences of not fixing it?”

**3) Build the timeline (the JTBD backbone)**
- “Walk me through the story from the first sign of the problem to today.”
- “What did you try first? Then what? What happened each time?”
- “When did it become urgent? What changed?”
- “Who else was involved at each step, and what did they care about?”

**4) Uncover the job (functional + emotional + social)**
- “In that situation, what were you really trying to get done?”
- “How would you describe the ‘progress’ you wanted to make?”
- “How did you want to feel during/after solving it?”
- “How did you want to be seen by others (team, boss, customers) after this was handled?”

**5) Desired outcomes (make them measurable)**
- “How do you know this is working? What does success look like?”
- “What would be a great outcome vs. acceptable?”
- “What would be a deal-breaker outcome?”
- “What do you optimize for: time, cost, risk, quality, control, flexibility?”

**6) Previous solutions + alternatives (competition = anything)**
- “What were you using before (tools, spreadsheets, agency, doing nothing)?”
- “What did you like about the old way? What did you hate?”
- “What other options did you seriously consider? Why not them?”
- “If our product didn’t exist, what would you do instead?”

**7) Switching forces (push/pull/anxiety/habit)**
- Push (pain): “What became unacceptable about the old way?”
- Pull (attraction): “What about this product made you think it could help?”
- Anxiety: “What worried you about switching? What felt risky?”
- Habit: “What nearly stopped you from changing at all?”

**8) Decision criteria + the moment of purchase**
- “What were the top 3 criteria you used to choose?”
- “What sealed the decision? What almost derailed it?”
- “What information did you need right before buying? Where did you look?”
- “Who needed to say yes? What objections came up, and how were they resolved?”

**9) First use + onboarding (value realization)**
- “What was the very first thing you did after signing up?”
- “What did you expect would happen immediately? What actually happened?”
- “When did you first think, ‘this was worth it’ (or ‘uh oh’)? What caused that?”
- “What was confusing or hard in the first week?”

**10) Ongoing job + moments that matter**
- “When do you reach for it now? What triggers that moment?”
- “What does a ‘good day’ using it look like?”
- “When do you avoid it or fall back to the old way, and why?”
- “What’s still unsolved or annoying?”

**11) Wrap (insight + language you can reuse)**
- “If you had to describe the problem to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?”
- “What would you tell someone like you who’s considering this?”
- “If we could wave a magic wand and improve one thing, what would have the biggest impact?”

If you tell me what your product is and who these customers are (role + scenario), I can tailor this into a 30–40 minute interview script with follow-ups specific to your domain.

**Providing interview advice**

The user is looking for general advice, not code. I need to provide an interview guide without naming any specific skills. I’ll include elements like timeline, push/pull factors, triggers, alternatives, desired outcomes, constraints, and success metrics. Structuring it with a warmup, a deep dive, and a wrap-up seems ideal. I should also prepare a question list with examples and tips like focusing on specific past events and using techniques like the 5 whys. Keeping it concise while covering everything is essential!
