# Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) for Product Discovery

**Jobs-to-be-Done** is a framework for understanding why customers make the choices they do. The core insight: people don't buy products—they "hire" them to make progress in a specific circumstance.

## The Core Concept

When someone buys a product, they're not buying features or benefits in the abstract. They have a **job** they need to get done, and they're hiring your product to do it. The job is defined by:

1. **The struggling moment** — a specific situation where someone feels stuck
2. **The desired progress** — what "better" looks like for them
3. **The context** — circumstances that shape what solution will work

The classic example: McDonald's discovered people were "hiring" milkshakes for two completely different jobs. Morning commuters wanted something to make a boring drive interesting and keep them full until lunch. Afternoon parents wanted something to say "yes" to their kids. Same product, different jobs, different competitors.

## When to Use JTBD

- Understanding why customers buy, switch, or churn
- Identifying who your real competitors are (often not who you think)
- Designing features that address actual demand
- Crafting messaging that resonates with buyer motivation
- Prioritizing what to build based on struggling moments

## The Four Forces of Progress

Every switch decision involves four forces:

```
PUSH (from current situation)     PULL (toward new solution)
        ↓                                    ↓
    [Current]  ─────────────────────>  [New Solution]
        ↑                                    ↑
HABIT (staying put)               ANXIETY (about switching)
```

- **Push**: Frustration with the current situation
- **Pull**: Attraction to a new solution
- **Anxiety**: Fear about the new solution (Will it work? Will I look stupid?)
- **Habit**: Comfort with the status quo (even if it's painful)

**Key insight**: You can grow by increasing Push/Pull OR by reducing Anxiety/Habit. Reducing friction is often easier than adding features.

## How to Apply It: The Switch Interview

Interview people who **recently switched** to or from your product (within 90 days). Don't interview prospects or long-time customers—they can't recall the decision accurately.

**Interview structure:**

1. **First thought** — "When did you first realize you needed something?"
2. **Event timeline** — "Walk me through what happened next..."
3. **The struggle** — "What wasn't working before?"
4. **Consideration set** — "What else did you consider?"
5. **The pushback** — "What almost stopped you from switching?"
6. **The trigger** — "What made you finally pull the trigger?"

**Critical technique**: Don't ask "why." Ask "walk me through what happened." Why invites rationalization; timeline questions uncover the real story.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Interviewing prospects | They haven't switched yet—they'll rationalize, not recall |
| Asking "why did you buy?" | Gets post-hoc justification, not the real story |
| Job statements too broad | "Save time" is useless—needs context + outcome |
| Ignoring anxiety/habit | You're only seeing half the forces |
| Confusing complaints with jobs | "Bitching ain't switching"—complaints don't predict action |
| Following power users | They're often edge cases, not your growth path |

## What Makes a Good Job Statement

**Bad**: "I want to save time"  
**Good**: "When I'm running late for work and need breakfast, help me eat something filling that I can consume one-handed while driving"

A useful job statement includes:
- **Context/circumstance** (when I'm...)
- **Desired progress** (help me...)
- **Constraints** (so that I can...)

## Quick Application Checklist

- [ ] Interview 8-12 recent switchers (last 90 days)
- [ ] Map the timeline from first thought to purchase
- [ ] Identify all four forces for each interview
- [ ] Look for patterns in struggling moments, not demographics
- [ ] Define jobs with context, not just outcomes
- [ ] Identify the *real* competitors (what they did before)
- [ ] Test messaging against the forces you discovered

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We keep building features customers say they want, but adoption is low. I think we're missing something about why they actually buy. How do I figure out the real motivation?
```

Response:

```
This is exactly what **Jobs to be Done (JTBD)** helps with. The gap between what customers *say* they want and what actually drives adoption is usually about understanding the *progress* they're trying to make in their lives—not the features they request.

Here's how to figure out the real motivation:

## The Core Insight

Customers don't buy products—they "hire" them to make progress in a specific situation. When adoption is low despite building requested features, you're likely solving the wrong problem or missing the emotional/social dimensions of the job.

## What To Do

**1. Interview recent switchers (not prospects)**
- Talk to people who *actually bought* in the last 90 days
- Ask them to walk you through the timeline: "When did you first start looking? What was happening in your life?"
- Don't ask "why"—ask "what happened next?"

**2. Uncover the Four Forces**
- **Push**: What was frustrating about the old way?
- **Pull**: What attracted them to the new solution?
- **Anxiety**: What concerns almost stopped them?
- **Habit**: What made the old way comfortable despite problems?

Most teams only look at Push and Pull. The real insight is often in Anxiety and Habit—the forces that *prevent* switching.

**3. Find the struggling moment**
- What triggered the search? ("I was in a meeting and couldn't find the file...")
- The context matters more than the feature. Same person in a different context = different job.

**4. Listen for emotional and social progress**
- Functional: "I need to get this done"
- Emotional: "I want to feel confident/in control"
- Social: "I want to look competent to my team"

Features often nail the functional but miss the emotional.

## Red Flags You're Off Track

- You're asking customers "what features do you want?"
- Your job statement is too broad ("save time", "be more productive")
- You're interviewing prospects instead of people who already switched
- Customers complain but don't actually change behavior ("bitching ain't switching")

Would you like help structuring customer interviews to uncover real jobs, or analyzing interview data you already have?

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me prep for JTBD interviews. I'm talking to 10 recent customers this week. What questions should I ask to uncover their actual job-to-be-done?
```

Response:

```
Here's your JTBD interview prep:

## Core Principle: Story, Not Reasons

**Never ask "why"** — it triggers rationalization. Ask them to walk you through what happened. The job is hiding in the story.

## Interview Structure

### Opening (set context)
> "Take me back to when you first started thinking about finding a solution like ours. What was going on in your life?"

### Uncover the Four Forces

**Push (current pain)**
- "What was the moment that made you say 'I have to do something about this'?"
- "What had you tried before that didn't work?"
- "What was going on that made the old way stop working?"

**Pull (hoped-for outcome)**
- "When you imagined life with a new solution, what did that look like?"
- "What were you hoping would be different?"
- "What outcome were you trying to achieve?"

**Anxiety (fears about switching)**
- "What concerns did you have about switching?"
- "What almost stopped you from buying?"
- "What did you need to believe before you could commit?"

**Habit (comfort with status quo)**
- "What did you have to give up to make this work?"
- "What made the old way comfortable despite its problems?"
- "Who else did you need to convince?"

### Find the Decision Moment
- "Walk me through the moment you decided this was the one"
- "What was the tipping point?"
- "What would have made you choose differently?"

## Techniques for Getting Past Surface Answers

First answers are always "pablum" — generic and safe. Push deeper:

| Technique | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **"Tell me more..."** | "Tell me more about 'easy to use' — what were you worried wouldn't be easy?" |
| **"What do you mean by..."** | "What do you mean by 'better'? Better how?" |
| **Play it back wrong** | "So you bought it mainly because of the price?" (when you know it wasn't) — they'll correct you with the real reason |
| **Bracket when stuck** | "Was it more about X or more about Y?" (force articulation) |

---

## What You're Listening For

Build the timeline:
1. **First thought** — what cracked the status quo?
2. **Passive looking** — what triggered active research?
3. **Active looking** — what were they comparing?
4. **Deciding** — what tipped them over?
5. **First use** — did reality match expectation?

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Accepting "it was easy" or "good reviews"** — push 2-3 questions deeper
- **Asking what they want** — study what they *did*
- **Ignoring the irrational** — when something seems crazy, you're missing context
- **Only getting Push + Pull** — Anxiety and Habit explain why people *don't* switch

---

## After 10 Interviews

Look for **pathways**, not themes. You'll likely find 3-5 distinct jobs. Cluster interviews by similar combinations of Push + Pull + Anxiety + Habit, not demographics.

Format each job as:
> When I am [CONTEXT], help me [MOTIVATION], so I can [OUTCOME].

Patterns typically emerge by interview 7-8. If you're still confused, you're probably not pushing past the pablum layer.
