Prompt:

```
What is product-led growth and when does it make sense vs. sales-led?
```

Response:

```
Product-led growth (PLG) is a go-to-market strategy where the product itself is the primary driver of customer acquisition, conversion, and expansion. Users can sign up, experience value, and often even pay without talking to sales.

## Core Characteristics of PLG

- **Self-serve onboarding**: Users can start using the product independently
- **Free entry point**: Either freemium or free trial
- **Value before commitment**: Users experience the product's benefit before paying
- **Product-qualified leads**: Sales focuses on users who've already activated, not cold prospects

## When PLG Makes Sense

1. **End users can adopt independently** - The product solves a problem an individual can act on without organizational buy-in (Slack, Figma, Notion)
2. **Time-to-value is short** - Users get meaningful value in minutes or hours, not weeks
3. **Low complexity to start** - Doesn't require integration, training, or configuration to see benefit
4. **Viral or network dynamics** - Usage naturally spreads (collaboration tools, shared outputs)
5. **Large addressable market** - Volume economics work because many users can self-serve

## When Sales-Led Makes More Sense

1. **High-touch required** - Complex implementation, security reviews, or customization needed upfront
2. **Buyer ≠ User** - The person who pays isn't the one who uses it (enterprise software where procurement decides)
3. **High ACV, low volume** - Deals are large enough that sales economics work ($50K+ contracts)
4. **Regulatory/compliance requirements** - Customers need hand-holding through legal and security processes
5. **No individual use case** - The product only makes sense at the team/org level from day one

## The Hybrid Reality

Most successful companies blend both. Atlassian started PLG but added sales for enterprise. Salesforce is sales-led but has self-serve trials. The question isn't either/or—it's which motion *leads* and when to layer in the other.

**Key insight**: PLG works when you can get users to experience the "aha moment" without human intervention. If that's not possible with your product, sales-led is likely the better primary motion.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We currently sell through enterprise sales but close rates are low and the cycle is 6+ months. Should we add a self-serve tier? How do we think about this?
```

Response:

```
This is a classic strategic question that several frameworks in this repo can help with. Let me pull together the relevant thinking.

## The Core Question: Is Self-Serve Right for You?

Adding self-serve isn't just a pricing decision—it's a **business model change** that affects product, sales, marketing, and support. Here's how to think through it:

### 1. Does Your Product Have an Individual Use Case?

From the Product-Led Growth framework: PLG only works if **individual users can get value before the company buys**. 

**Ask yourself:**
- Can someone use your product alone and find it valuable?
- Or does value only emerge at team/company scale?

If your product requires org-wide deployment to show value (like an ERP or security tool), self-serve will generate tire-kickers, not buyers.

### 2. What's Actually Causing the Long Sales Cycle?

Before adding complexity, diagnose the real problem:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Self-Serve Helps? |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| "We need to see it work first" | Trust/proof gap | **Yes** - trial reduces risk |
| "We need legal/security review" | Enterprise requirements | **No** - still need those |
| "We're not sure what we need" | Unclear value prop | **No** - need better positioning |
| "We need buy-in from 5 stakeholders" | Complex buying committee | **Maybe** - bottom-up can bypass |

### 3. The Counter-Positioning Risk

From Seven Powers: If you're winning enterprise deals (even slowly), you have something incumbents can't easily copy. Self-serve might:
- **Dilute your positioning** as "enterprise-grade"
- **Distract your team** from what's actually working
- **Cannibalize revenue** if enterprises start on free tier and stay there

### 4. A Better Frame: Trial vs. Freemium vs. Self-Serve Paid

These are different things:

| Model | When It Works |
|-------|---------------|
| **Free trial** (time-limited) | Complex product, need to experience value |
| **Freemium** (feature-limited) | Clear free→paid upgrade trigger, viral potential |
| **Self-serve paid** | Low price point, simple buying decision |

For enterprise products with 6-month cycles, **a structured pilot program** often works better than self-serve. It's still "try before you buy" but with white-glove support that matches enterprise expectations.

### 5. Questions to Pressure-Test

Before building self-serve:

1. **Who would actually use it?** If the answer is "smaller companies," are those customers you want? Do they have the same problem your enterprise customers have?

2. **What's your time-to-value?** If setup takes days/weeks, self-serve users will churn before they activate.

3. **Can you support two motions?** Self-serve requires different skills (product, content, support) than enterprise sales. Doing both poorly is worse than doing one well.

4. **What does your pipeline say?** Do you have inbound demand from people who *want* to self-serve? Or are you guessing?

### My Recommendation

Given 6-month cycles and enterprise sales:

1. **First, fix the cycle** - Map where deals stall. Is it technical validation? Legal? Champion building? Each has different solutions.

2. **Consider a "product-assisted" sale** - Give prospects a sandbox or limited pilot they control, but keep sales involved. This addresses "we need to see it work" without full self-serve.

3. **If you do add self-serve**, start with **free trial, not freemium** - Time-limited trials create urgency and qualify intent. Freemium can become a support burden with no revenue.

4. **Separate the segments clearly** - If self-serve is for SMB and enterprise is for... enterprise, make sure they're actually different ICPs with different needs. Don't let enterprise buyers "start small" on self-serve.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me design a PLG motion for our analytics tool. We want a free tier that converts to paid. What should be free vs. paid? How do we design the upgrade triggers?
```

Response:

```
Now I have the full PLG framework. Let me give you a comprehensive answer for your analytics tool.

## PLG Motion Design for Your Analytics Tool

### The Core Principle

**Free should create demand for paid, not satisfy it.** Your free tier is a taste, not the meal. Users should hit natural friction points that make them *want* to upgrade.

---

### Free vs. Paid: Framework for Analytics

For an analytics tool, here's how to think about the split:

| **FREE** (Create the habit) | **PAID** (Unlock scale + depth) |
|---|---|
| Core tracking & dashboards | Advanced analytics (funnels, cohorts, retention) |
| Limited events/month (e.g., 10K) | Higher/unlimited event volume |
| 1-3 users | Unlimited team members |
| 30-day data retention | 12+ month retention |
| Basic charts & metrics | Custom dashboards, SQL access |
| Standard reports | Automated reports, scheduled emails |
| Community support | Priority support |

**The key insight:** Free users should be able to answer "what happened?" but need paid to answer "why did it happen?" and "what should we do about it?"

### What to Keep Free (Non-Negotiables)

1. **The aha moment path** — Whatever gets users to first value must be free. For analytics: install SDK → see first data in dashboard
2. **Enough depth to create habits** — If free is too shallow, users won't get hooked
3. **Collaboration hooks** — If your growth depends on users inviting teammates, invites must be free (even if you limit seats)

### What to Gate Behind Paid

Gate features that:
- **Scale** — More events, more users, more data history
- **Go deeper** — Advanced analysis types (funnels, cohorts, predictive)
- **Save time** — Automation, templates, integrations
- **Serve teams** — Permissions, audit logs, SSO

---

### Upgrade Triggers: The Playbook

**75% of free users don't know what you're selling.** Your #1 conversion lever is often just making paid features visible.

#### 1. Usage Walls (Volume Limits)
Show progress toward limits and what happens when they hit them:
```
"You've tracked 8,200 of 10,000 events this month. 
Upgrade to Pro for unlimited tracking."
```

#### 2. Feature Walls (Show, Don't Hide)
When users try to access paid features, don't just block — sell:
```
"Funnel Analysis is a Pro feature. 
See where users drop off in your signup flow.
[Watch 30-sec demo] [Upgrade to Pro]"
```

**Design rule:** Every paid feature should be visible to free users (grayed out, locked icon) with clear value explanation. Don't hide paid features — that kills awareness.

#### 3. Time Walls (Data Retention)
```
"Your data older than 30 days will be archived.
Upgrade to keep 12 months of history."
```

#### 4. Collaboration Walls
```
"You've invited 3 teammates (max for free).
Upgrade for unlimited team members."
```

#### 5. Behavioral Signals (for Sales-Assist)
Track these to identify accounts ready for sales outreach:
- **7+ users from same domain** (magic threshold)
- **Admin role changes** (someone taking ownership)
- **Terms of service page views** (procurement sniffing around)
- **Velocity spikes** (sudden increase in usage)

---

### Design Principles for Your Upgrade Experience

1. **Rule of Three** — Users need to see upgrade opportunities 3+ times before they remember them
2. **Consistent visual language** — Use one color/treatment for all upgrade CTAs (e.g., gold accent)
3. **Show the value, not just the lock** — "Advanced funnels" means nothing. "See exactly where users abandon checkout" means something.
4. **Design from free state** — Every feature review should ask: "Can a free user see this exists? Do they understand why they'd want it?"

---

### Quick Decision: Freemium vs. Free Trial?

For analytics tools, **freemium usually wins** because:
- Value compounds over time (more data = more useful)
- Users need to integrate the SDK — that's an investment
- Network effects if teams share dashboards
- Long enterprise sales cycles (12+ months)

Consider a **hybrid**: Freemium for individuals, 14-day trial of Pro for team evaluation.

---

### Red Flags to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Fails |
|---------|--------------|
| Free tier is too generous | 0.5% conversion. Users have no reason to pay. |
| Paid features invisible to free users | 80% can't name a single paid feature |
| Sales spamming new signups | They just signed up — they're not ready to buy |
| Only showing upgrade on pricing page | Users never go there organically |
