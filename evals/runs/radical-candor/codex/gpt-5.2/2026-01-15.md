Prompt:

```
Explain Radical Candor. How do I give feedback that's both caring and direct?
```

Response:

```
Radical Candor is a feedback approach built on two behaviors at the same time: **care personally** (you’re on their side as a human) and **challenge directly** (you’re clear about what needs to change). When you do both, people can trust your intent and understand your message, so feedback is easier to hear and act on.

**How to be caring and direct**
- Start with shared intent: “I want you to succeed here, so I’m going to be specific.”
- Be behavior-specific, not personality-based: describe what happened, not who they are.
- Name impact and stakes: why it matters (team, customer, quality, timeline).
- Ask for their view, then align on next time: “How did that land?” + “What will you do differently?”
- Offer support without softening the point: “I’ll help with X, and I need Y to change.”

**A simple script**
- “When you **[observable behavior]**, it **[impact]**. I know you care about **[goal]**. Next time, can you **[specific change]**? How do you see it?”

**Example**
- “In today’s meeting, you interrupted Priya twice, and we lost her input. I know you want the best decision. Next time, can you wait until she finishes and then ask your question? If you want, I can signal you when you’re jumping in.”

If you tell me the situation (role relationship, what happened, and what you want to change), I can draft a few versions: gentle, neutral, and very direct.

Explain Radical Candor. How do I give feedback that's both caring and direct?

**Explaining a concept**

The user is asking for an explanation of a concept along with some how-to guidance. I realize I don't need any tools here and should focus on providing concise, actionable advice. I’ll include a definition, a quadrant framework, script templates, steps, and examples to clarify the concept. I'll aim to keep it structured with about 6-10 sentences or bullet points, possibly using a couple of headings, but I won't add emojis as per the instructions.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
I need to tell a direct report that their work quality has dropped, but I'm worried about damaging the relationship. How do I have this conversation?
```

Response:

```
Have it as a performance conversation with care: clear, specific, and supportive. The relationship is usually damaged more by vagueness and surprise than by direct, respectful feedback.

**Before the meeting (10–15 min prep)**
- Pick 2–3 concrete examples from the last 4–8 weeks (missed requirements, higher defect rate, sloppy analysis, rework, stakeholder complaints). Bring facts, not a “general vibe.”
- Clarify the impact (time lost, customer risk, teammate load, trust).
- Decide what “good” looks like going forward (definition of done, review checklist, turnaround times, quality bar).
- Reserve enough time (30–45 min) and do it privately, synchronous.

**Conversation structure (works well)**
1) **Open with intent + safety**
- “I want to talk about work quality. I’m bringing it up because I value you and I want you to be successful here.”

2) **State the observation (specific)**
- “Over the last month, I’ve noticed a drop in quality in a few deliverables.”

3) **Give 2–3 examples + impact**
- “For example, in the [X] doc, key assumptions were missing and we had to redo sections after review. In the [Y] release, we had [Z] bugs/rollbacks. The impact is we’re spending extra cycles and it’s affecting trust with stakeholders.”

4) **Ask for their perspective (and listen)**
- “What’s going on from your side?”  
Then pause. You’re looking for workload, unclear expectations, personal issues, burnout, skill gaps, motivation, changes in scope, or conflicts.

5) **Align on expectations**
- “Going forward, I need [specific standard]. That means [behaviors/process], not just ‘be more careful.’”

6) **Co-create an improvement plan (support + accountability)**
- “What would help you meet that bar?”  
Offer supports like:
  - Smaller milestones/checkpoints before final delivery
  - A pre-submit checklist (requirements, edge cases, data validation, peer review)
  - Pairing/review buddy for 2–3 weeks
  - Clearer success criteria and examples of “A-level” work
  - Adjusting workload or deadlines if they’re overloaded

7) **Make it measurable + time-bound**
- “For the next 4 weeks, let’s measure: fewer reworks, fewer defects, and on-time delivery with [checklist/review steps]. We’ll do a 15-min quality check-in twice a week.”

8) **Close with confidence + next steps**
- “I’m confident you can get back to your usual level, and I’ll support you—but the quality has to improve. Let’s recap what we agreed and I’ll write it up.”

**A talk track you can use (tight and respectful)**
- “I want to discuss something important: the quality of your recent work. I’ve seen a noticeable drop over the last month—specifically [example 1] and [example 2]. The impact has been [impact]. I’m raising this because I want you to succeed and because the current level isn’t meeting expectations. What’s driving this from your perspective?”

**What to avoid (relationship-damaging patterns)**
- “You’ve been sloppy lately” (judgment) instead of “These items missed X requirement” (fact).
- Overloading them with 10 examples (feels like a prosecution).
- Making it about personality (“you’re careless”) instead of behavior and outcomes.
- Ending without a clear standard and plan (they leave anxious and unsure).

**If they get emotional or defensive**
- Name it gently: “I can see this is hard to hear.”  
- Re-anchor to shared goal: “I’m on your side. Let’s focus on what will help you deliver great work consistently.”  
- If they deny: “I hear you. Let’s look at these two specific cases together and align on what ‘done’ means.”

If you tell me their role, the kind of work (docs/code/design/ops), and one or two examples of the quality drop, I can help you craft a more tailored script and a simple improvement plan you can document.

**Providing managerial advice**

I'm focusing on giving concise and practical advice, without needing any tools. I want to structure this with clear steps and consider emotions, along with a follow-up plan. Key concepts like situational leadership and the SBI (Situation, Behavior, Impact) model should be mentioned. I'll include questions to ask and clarify expectations, along with a talk track of do's and don'ts, especially since the user is a manager. I'll keep verbosity low but still informative.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me prepare feedback using Radical Candor. My engineer keeps missing deadlines and making excuses. I care about them but this can't continue. What do I say?
```

Response:

```
Use this Radical Candor structure: **care personally + challenge directly**, grounded in **specifics**, ending with **clear expectations and support**.

**What to say (script)**
- “I want to talk about delivery. I care about you and I want you to be successful here, and I also need to be direct: the pattern of missed deadlines has to change.”
- “In the last [timeframe], we missed [Project/Task A] by [X], and [Task B] by [Y]. In both cases, the dates moved late in the cycle.”
- “The impact is [missed commitments to other teams/customers, rework, others waiting, loss of trust].”
- “I’m not bringing this up to blame you. I want to understand what’s driving it and fix it together. What’s getting in your way?”
- (After they answer) “Thanks. Here’s what I need going forward:  
  1) When you commit to a date, I need it to be realistic.  
  2) If you see risk, raise it early—ideally as soon as you’re 20–30% in, not near the deadline.  
  3) I need a written status update [cadence] with what’s done, what’s next, and any blockers.”
- “If something slips, I need you to bring options: reduce scope, ask for help, or propose a new date with tradeoffs—rather than explanations after the fact.”
- “To support you, I can [pair on planning, help break work down, remove blockers, get you code reviews faster, adjust scope]. What would help most?”
- “Let’s agree on a plan for the next [2–4] weeks and revisit on [date]. If we don’t see improvement, we’ll need to escalate to a performance plan. I don’t want that, so let’s make the change now.”

**If they make excuses (use these redirects)**
- “I hear you. Regardless of the reason, the outcome is missed commitments. Let’s focus on what we’ll do differently next time.”
- “What did we know earlier that we didn’t act on? When should you have flagged risk?”
- “What’s one concrete change you’ll make on the next project to prevent this?”
- “If this happens again, what’s the earliest signal we can agree you’ll communicate?”

**Set crisp expectations (choose 3–5)**
- Dates only after breaking into tasks + estimating.
- Default to smaller milestones; demo/checkpoint mid-sprint.
- Flag risks within 24 hours of discovering them.
- No silent slips; communicate in writing.
- If blocked >1 day, escalate.

**Follow-up note (send after)**
- “Recap: We discussed missed deadlines on [A/B] and the impact. Going forward you’ll [expectations], and I’ll support by [support]. We’ll review progress on [date].”

If you tell me their role/level, how often deadlines are missed, and whether the issue is estimation vs execution vs communication, I’ll tailor the script to your exact situation and tone.
