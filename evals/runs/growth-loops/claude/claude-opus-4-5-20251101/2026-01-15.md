Explain growth loops and how they differ from funnels.
```

Response:

## Growth Loops vs. Funnels

**Funnels** are linear, one-way flows: Awareness → Acquisition → Activation → Retention → Revenue. Each stage loses users, and you constantly need to pour new people in at the top to maintain output at the bottom.

**Growth loops** are circular, self-reinforcing systems where the output of one cycle becomes the input for the next. The key difference: loops compound, funnels deplete.

### How a Growth Loop Works

```
[New User] → [Takes Action] → [Creates Output] → [Attracts More Users] → [Repeat]
```

**Example: Pinterest's content loop**
1. User signs up
2. User saves/creates pins
3. Pins get indexed by Google
4. Someone searches, finds the pin
5. They sign up → cycle repeats

### Three Main Loop Types

| Loop Type | How It Works | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Viral** | Users invite other users directly | Dropbox referrals, Slack team invites |
| **Content** | User-generated content attracts new users via SEO/social | Pinterest, Stack Overflow, Yelp |
| **Paid** | Revenue funds acquisition that generates more revenue | Subscription businesses reinvesting in ads |

### Why This Matters

With funnels, growth is additive—you spend $X, you get Y users. With loops, growth is multiplicative—each cohort of users generates the next cohort, so returns compound over time.

The practical implication: **optimize for the loop, not individual funnel stages**. A 10% improvement in a loop's cycle time or conversion rate compounds; a 10% improvement in one funnel stage is just linear.

### The Catch

Most companies only have **one primary loop** that drives the majority of growth. Trying to run multiple loops simultaneously usually means none of them work well. Find the one that fits your product and double down.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We're spending $50k/month on paid acquisition but growth flatlines whenever we pause ads. How do we build something more sustainable?
```

Response:

```
This is exactly your problem. Here's the diagnosis and path forward:

## The Core Problem

**Paid acquisition is not a growth loop — it's a tax you pay to platforms.** When you stop paying, growth stops. That's not a bug, it's how paid works.

The ratio should be **~80% earned/owned growth, ~20% paid**. You likely have this inverted.

## Funnels vs Loops

| Funnel Thinking (Your Current State) | Loop Thinking (Sustainable) |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Pour money into ads each month | Each user generates more users |
| CAC rises as competition bids up audiences | CAC decreases as loops compound |
| Growth stops when budget stops | Growth continues from existing users |

## What to Do

**Step 1: Identify your potential loops**

There are three main loop types:

1. **Viral loops** — Users invite/share with others who become users
2. **Content loops** — Users create content that attracts new users via search/discovery
3. **Sales loops** — Happy customers generate referrals, case studies, or expand within their org

**Step 2: Audit your product**

Ask: *"How does each user we acquire generate more users?"*

If the answer is "they don't" — that's your problem to solve. Examples:
- Can users share their output publicly? (content loop)
- Do users naturally collaborate with non-users? (viral loop)  
- Can you turn your best accounts into references? (sales loop)

**Step 3: Reframe paid's role**

Paid should **kindle the fire, not BE the fire**. Use it to:
- Seed content that ranks organically forever
- Get initial users who trigger viral loops
- Reach audiences that test new loops

## Practical Next Step

What does your product do? I can help you identify which loop type is most natural for your business and what product changes might unlock compounding growth.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me design a growth loop for our B2B SaaS product. Users create reports that get shared externally. What would the loop look like?
```

Response:

```
Based on the growth loops framework, your B2B SaaS has a natural **viral loop** built into the product. Here's how to design it:

## Your Growth Loop: Report Sharing Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   User creates   →   Shares report   →   Recipient sees    │
└──► report            externally          report + brand ───┘
                                           (signs up to 
                                            create their own)
```

### The Four Steps

1. **Input**: New user signs up
2. **Action**: User creates a report (core product value)
3. **Output**: Report gets shared with external stakeholders (clients, executives, partners)
4. **Connection**: Recipients see the report, notice the product, and sign up to create their own reports

### Make the Loop Work

**Strengthen the sharing moment:**
- Make shared reports look polished (recipients should be impressed)
- Include subtle but clear product branding: "Created with [Product]" with a link
- Let recipients interact with the report (not just view a PDF) — keeps them in your product

**Lower friction for recipients:**
- Let recipients view without login
- Offer a clear CTA: "Create your own report" or "Start free"
- Pre-fill context if possible (industry, report type they just viewed)

**Track the loop:**
- Tag every shared report with the source user
- Track recipient → signup → first report created
- Measure: What % of report recipients sign up? What's the time to first report?

### The B2B Layer: Product-Led Sales

Since you're B2B, layer in a **sales loop** on top:

```
Individual creates reports → Team adopts → 7+ users in account → Sales engages → Enterprise deal
```

**PQA signals to watch:**
- 7+ users in same company domain
- Rapid increase in users (velocity)
- Reports shared to executive-level domains
- Admin/settings page visits
- Pricing page views

### What NOT to Do

- Don't require login to view shared reports (kills the loop)
- Don't hide your branding on shared reports (you need attribution)
- Don't treat this as "viral marketing" bolted on — it's core to the product
- Don't expect the loop to work if reports aren't genuinely useful (product-market fit first)

### Key Metric

**Loop efficiency**: What percentage of externally-shared reports result in a new signup within 30 days?

Start by measuring this baseline, then optimize the weakest step.
