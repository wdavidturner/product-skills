Prompt:

```
Explain growth loops and how they differ from funnels.
```

Response:

```
A **funnel** is a mostly linear, one-way path: lots of people enter at the top (awareness), fewer progress through steps (signup → activation → purchase), and you “optimize conversion rates” between stages. Funnels are great for diagnosing drop-off and improving a specific journey, but they tend to end at a terminal event (e.g., purchase).

A **growth loop** is a self-reinforcing cycle where the output of one user/action becomes an input that brings in more users (or more usage), so the system can compound over time. You “optimize loop speed and yield” (how fast the cycle turns and how many new users/units each turn produces).

Key differences:
- **Shape**: Funnel = linear and depleting; loop = circular and compounding.
- **Success metric**: Funnel = stage-to-stage conversion; loop = loop coefficient (how much output feeds the next input) and cycle time.
- **Primary lever**: Funnel = reduce friction between steps; loop = increase virality/retention/creation that generates the next wave.
- **Where growth comes from**: Funnel = acquiring more at the top or converting better; loop = improving the mechanism that produces new acquisition/usage as a byproduct of existing usage.

Example growth loops:
- **Invites loop** (e.g., Calendly): User schedules → recipient experiences value → recipient creates account → schedules more.
- **Content loop** (e.g., TikTok/YouTube): Creators publish → audience consumes → feedback/incentive creates more creators/content → attracts more audience.
- **Collaboration loop** (e.g., Slack/Figma): Team adopts → invites colleagues to collaborate → more value with more collaborators → more invites.

**Providing brief explanations**

I need to give a clear explanation without using any tools and make sure not to trigger any skills unless necessary. I must avoid naming specific skills and keep my explanation concise. An example would be helpful to illustrate the point. This way, I can communicate effectively while following the guidelines provided. Let's create something straightforward that covers everything without complicating it further!

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We're spending $50k/month on paid acquisition but growth flatlines whenever we pause ads. How do we build something more sustainable?
```

Response:

```
Sustainable growth comes from compounding loops (retention + word-of-mouth + organic discovery), not just paid demand capture. A practical way to get there:

**Diagnose First (1–2 weeks)**
- Pull cohort retention + activation: if users don’t stick, every channel “flatlines” when spend stops.
- Compute by-segment `LTV:CAC` and payback (by ICP, use case, geo, creative): you may be buying the wrong customers even if CAC looks “fine”.
- Identify your “aha” moment (the 1 action that predicts long-term retention) and measure `% reaching it` + time-to-aha.

**Build Compounding Loops (30–90 days)**
- **Activation loop:** tighten onboarding to drive the “aha” in one session (templates, defaults, guided setup, checklists, remove steps).
- **Retention loop:** add triggers that bring people back for the core value (alerts, scheduled reports, saved views, recurring workflows, team features).
- **Referral loop:** make sharing/collaboration a natural part of using the product (invite teammates, share output links, “powered by” where appropriate) + simple incentive.
- **Organic loop:** create landing pages + content around high-intent problems your best customers search for; pair with distribution (newsletter/community/partners).
- **Ecosystem loop:** ship 1–2 high-leverage integrations that unlock directory traffic + in-product virality (e.g., Slack, Google, Shopify, HubSpot—depends on your ICP).

**How To Use Ads While You Fix It**
- Don’t pause to zero; cap spend and use paid as a testing lab (ICP, positioning, offer) and to retarget high-intent visitors—not as the primary engine.

If you answer these 3, I can make this very specific:
1) What’s the product + primary “job to be done”? 2) What are 8-week retention and activation rates today? 3) Who are your best customers (industry, size, use case) and where do they already hang out/search?

**Developing a growth strategy**

The user is looking for a sustainable product growth strategy rather than a technical coding solution. I’ll focus on details like product-led growth, retention, referrals, SEO, and partnerships. It’s important to ask some clarifying questions, such as how to build something more sustainable and what they envision for a 30/60/90 day plan. I need to keep it concise while mentioning metrics and actions for user acquisition, pricing, and experiments for growth.
thinking
**Structuring the response**

I need to create a structured output that includes headers and bullet points, aiming to keep it concise but informative. Although I want to stay within 10 lines, I can allow for some flexibility since this is a conceptual task. I'll plan for 2-3 headers and 5-8 bullet points. At the end, I'll include three key questions to engage the user. I’ll also mention that some skills won’t apply here, ensuring clarity in my immediate steps. Let's craft this response.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me design a growth loop for our B2B SaaS product. Users create reports that get shared externally. What would the loop look like?
```

Response:

```
**Core Loop (Report → External Share → Recipient → New User → More Reports)**

1) **Create value**: User builds a report that answers a recurring business question (template library + “last-mile” customization makes this fast).  
2) **Distribute externally**: Report is shared via link/embed/email/PDF with controlled access (view-only by default, expiring links, domain allowlist).  
3) **Recipient gets value**: Recipient views an interactive report (filters, drilldowns) and can take a lightweight action without an account (e.g., comment, annotate, request data).  
4) **Recipient converts**: Clear CTA appears at the moment of value: “Make a copy,” “Create your own report,” “Connect your data,” or “Subscribe to updates.” Recipient signs up (ideally SSO / email domain capture) and joins or creates a workspace.  
5) **New user activates**: They start from the shared report as a template (or “fork”), connect their dataset, and publish their first report quickly.  
6) **Reinforcement**: Reports are scheduled (weekly/monthly) and re-shared to broader external lists; embeds live in portals/wiki; each view creates new recipient surface area → back to step 3.

**Key Viral/Conversion Mechanics**
- **Forkable reports**: “Use this report” creates a new workspace artifact, preserving layout/logic but prompting data connection.  
- **Recipient actions that require identity**: commenting, saving views, exporting, setting alerts, subscribing—each is a conversion hook.  
- **Attribution + trust**: “Powered by …” plus sender identity, audit trail, and access controls (critical for B2B).  
- **Distribution expansion**: “Add recipients,” “Share to domain,” “Publish to portal,” “Scheduled digest” increases reach per report.

**What to Measure (to validate the loop)**
- Report creation rate → share rate → external view rate → engaged view rate (time/scroll/filter)  
- Recipient-to-signup conversion (by CTA type)  
- Signup-to-first-report activation (time-to-first-publish)  
- Re-share rate from newly activated users (loop closure)

If you tell me (1) who the typical external recipients are (customers vs partners vs execs) and (2) your pricing motion (PLG self-serve vs sales-led), I can tighten the CTAs/gates and pick the best “conversion moment” in the shared experience.

**Designing Growth Loops**

I don't need to make any code changes; instead, I should focus on the conceptual loop design. The user hasn't indicated any specific skills, so I'll craft a growth loop that includes steps, metrics, experiments, and anti-spam strategies. 

I should outline points in a concise manner, possibly in a bullet list format. Key elements will include creating a report, sharing externally, providing viewer value, clear CTAs, and promoting sign-ups. 

I should also incorporate aspects like templates, embedding, and scheduled emails for B2B scenarios. It’s crucial to emphasize recipient conversion and encouraging internal virality. I'll also create a loop diagram and ask 1-2 clarifying questions to refine my design.
thinking
**Crafting a Growth Strategy**

I need to create a growth loop strategy that includes several key components. First, the trigger will be the report creation. The sharing mechanisms should involve links, PDFs, and embedded options. 

I should ensure recipient engagement by allowing actions such as commenting, requesting access, exporting, subscribing, or even creating their own reports. 

For conversion, I'll emphasize signing up, creating workspaces, and importing data. Finally, I must incorporate activation through templates and sample data, focusing on recurring reports and distribution lists while highlighting compliance features and brand controls. Let's keep this succinct!
