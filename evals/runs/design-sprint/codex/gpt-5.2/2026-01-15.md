Prompt:

```
How do I run a design sprint? Walk me through the process.
```

Response:

```
A “design sprint” is a time‑boxed workshop (usually 4–5 days) where a cross‑functional team aligns on a problem, explores solutions, builds a realistic prototype, and tests it with target users to make a decision fast.

**When To Use**
- High uncertainty: you need evidence before building.
- Cross‑team misalignment: lots of opinions, no decision.
- Big UX/product bets: new flow, new feature, new positioning.

**People (Minimum 5–7)**
- Facilitator (runs the process, enforces timeboxes)
- Decider (can make final calls in the room)
- Product (problem framing, constraints)
- Design (prototype lead)
- Engineering (feasibility, tech constraints)
- Research (recruiting, interview plan, synthesis)
- Optional: Sales/Support/Data/Legal as “experts” for short segments

**Pre‑Work (1–5 days before)**
- Define a crisp sprint challenge: “How might we…?” + success metric.
- Choose the sprint target (one user journey / moment that matters).
- Gather inputs: current data, customer quotes, support tickets, competitor examples.
- Recruit 5 target users for testing (more if segments differ).
- Set tools + logistics (room, whiteboard, Figma, interview script, prototype plan).
- Write “sprint rules”: phones down, no laptops (except prototyping), equal voice, timeboxes.

---

## 5‑Day Sprint Walkthrough (Classic Format)

### Day 1 — Understand + Map
Goal: align on the problem and pick the right slice to sprint.
- Kickoff: goal, constraints, timeline, decision criteria.
- Expert interviews (10–20 min each): tech, market, customer, ops.
- Make a simple end‑to‑end journey map (user steps + pain points).
- Capture “How Might We” notes throughout (one idea per note).
- Pick a target: the most important step in the journey to improve/test.
**Outputs:** sprint goal, target user + scenario, journey map, prioritized “HMW” list.

### Day 2 — Ideate (Diverge)
Goal: generate strong solution approaches individually (avoid groupthink).
- Lightning demos: 3–5 comparable products/flows; extract patterns.
- Sketching (solo):
  - Notes → rough ideas → “Crazy 8s” (8 ideas in 8 minutes)
  - Solution sketch (detailed, 1–3 panels, anonymous if possible)
**Outputs:** a set of solution sketches ready to critique.

### Day 3 — Decide (Converge)
Goal: choose the concept(s) to prototype.
- Gallery walk: silently review sketches.
- Structured critique: what works, risks, open questions.
- Vote (dot voting) + Decider picks the winner(s).
- Storyboard the prototype flow step‑by‑step (8–15 frames).
**Outputs:** storyboard + prototype scope (what’s in/out), assumptions to test.

### Day 4 — Prototype
Goal: build a “real enough” prototype to get truthful user reactions.
- Assign roles:
  - Maker(s): build screens/flow
  - Stitcher: ensures one coherent path
  - Writer: copy/microcopy
  - Asset collector: images/icons/data
  - Interview lead: finalizes test script
- Prototype to test the key hypotheses, not the full product.
- Do a rehearsal: run the prototype end‑to‑end and fix rough edges.
**Outputs:** testable prototype + interview script.

### Day 5 — Test + Learn
Goal: validate assumptions with target users and decide next steps.
- 5 user interviews (45–60 min each), 1:1 moderated.
- Team observes, takes notes in a shared template (quotes + reactions + issues).
- After each interview: quick debrief, tag themes.
- End‑of‑day synthesis:
  - What patterns repeated?
  - What failed/was confusing?
  - What surprised us?
  - Decision: proceed / iterate / pivot / stop.
**Outputs:** findings summary, decision, prioritized next steps.

---

## Practical Facilitation Tips
- Protect timeboxes; momentum is the point.
- Prefer “work alone, share together” to avoid loud‑voice bias.
- Keep the prototype narrow: one critical path + key screens.
- Write decisions down as you go (scope, assumptions, “we will test X”).

## Common Pitfalls
- Vague challenge (“improve onboarding”): pick one moment and a metric.
- Too many stakeholders in the room: keep the core team small; rotate experts in.
- Overbuilding the prototype: realism helps, but speed matters more.
- Testing the wrong users: recruiting accuracy beats sample size.

## After The Sprint (Next 48 Hours)
- Send a 1–2 page readout: goal, prototype, top insights, decision, next plan.
- Convert findings into backlog items: fixes, follow‑up experiments, build plan.
- If you’re building: define an MVP spec based on what tested well.

If you tell me your product area and the decision you’re trying to make, I can suggest a sprint challenge statement, a target journey slice, and a day‑by‑day agenda tailored to it.

**Providing a Sprint Walkthrough**

The user is looking for a general process walkthrough without needing any code or tools. I should summarize the five-day sprint methodology from Google Ventures, while keeping it concise yet thorough. I can outline the preparation steps (defining challenges, recruiting team members, and logistics) and provide a day-by-day breakdown, including roles like decider, facilitator, designer, engineer, PM, and researcher. I'll offer facilitation tips, sample schedules, key deliverables, and best practices without being overly verbose. This will result in a structured guide that is clear and actionable.
thinking
**Outlining the Sprint Steps**

The five-day sprint plan is structured as follows: Day 1 is for understanding the problem, Day 2 is dedicated to ideation, Day 3 focuses on making decisions, Day 4 involves prototyping, and Day 5 is for testing the prototype. I should definitely include time-boxed steps with expected outputs for each day. After the sprint, it's important to synthesize findings, have a decision meeting, and outline the next steps to ensure everything progresses smoothly.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We have a new feature idea but no one agrees on what to build. Leadership wants us to validate it fast before committing engineering resources. What's the best way to do this in a week?
```

Response:

```
Best way to validate in a week: agree on the *riskiest assumption*, pre-commit to *success thresholds*, and run a *prototype + concierge (“Wizard of Oz”) test* that measures real intent (not opinions) with near-zero engineering.

**1-week plan**
- **Day 1 (90 minutes):** Write a 1-page “test card”: target user, job-to-be-done, value prop, top 2 assumptions, and a kill/commit metric (e.g., “2/10 will pay $X”, “20% of qualified will request access”, “5/5 can complete task in prototype without help”).
- **Day 2:** Build a clickable prototype (Figma) + a simple landing page (signup/“request access” + 2–3 value prop variants). Set up basic tracking (visits → clicks → signup).
- **Days 3–4:** Run **10–15** target-user sessions (30 min) using the prototype; end every session with a commitment ask: **pay**, **book a pilot**, **send data**, **introduce buyer**, or **let you do it for them this week**.
- **Days 3–5 (in parallel):** Do a **concierge pilot** with **3–5** users: manually deliver the outcome behind the scenes (no product), measure time-to-value, repeat usage, and what breaks.
- **Day 5:** Summarize results against thresholds, list top objections, and decide **kill / pivot / build**. If “build”, specify the smallest wedge feature that delivers the promised outcome.

**What to optimize for (signals that de-risk engineering)**
- Concrete commitments: payments, signed LOIs, booked pilots, or repeated usage in concierge.
- Clear ICP + use case: you can name who it’s for, when they use it, and what they stop doing instead.
- A narrow “first release” that matches what users actually tried to do in the test.

If you tell me your user + the idea in one sentence and what channels you can recruit from (customers, sales pipeline, consumer audience, etc.), I can suggest the exact test type and success metrics to use.

**Planning Product Validation**

The user is looking for a product validation approach without repo changes, so I need to keep it concise. I should outline a one-week plan that includes defining the hypothesis and identifying the riskiest assumptions. Key methods could be fake doors, concierge steps, prototypes, and interviews.

I want to emphasize "fast validation before engineering," focusing on no-code tools and manual services. I should provide a simple schedule with deliverables and sample metrics, all while possibly asking a few questions for clarity. Let's start with the proposed method and timeline.
thinking
**Drafting a One-Week Plan**

I've outlined a one-week plan focusing on product validation. On days 0/1, I'll conduct an alignment workshop to clarify the problem statement and target user, while listing and prioritizing assumptions. On day 2, I’ll create necessary artifacts, like a prototype and landing page, and set up email capture.

Days 3 and 4 are for running interviews and a concierge pilot with 3-5 users, plus possibly a fake door test. Finally, on day 5, I’ll analyze the results and provide a decision memo. Success criteria include sign-up rates and user engagement metrics. Only commit to engineering if thresholds are met.
thinking
**Crafting a Clear Response**

I need to advise the user to focus on a single "wedge" use case rather than trying to build a full platform. This helps minimize engineering resources by using no-code and manual methods. I’ll create a concise response with 6-8 bullet points outlining the approach, though I'm considering whether to use section headers for clarity.

I think a structured **Week Plan** could really help here. I'll keep things straightforward and concise, possibly emphasizing key points in bold to guide the user effectively. Let’s get started!

```
**Week Plan**
- **Day 1 (Mon) — Understand & Map**: Align on the sprint challenge, business/user goals, constraints, and success metrics; review existing research/data; map the end-to-end user journey; pick a target moment to improve. **Output**: sprint goal + key questions, journey map, target area, list of assumptions/risks.
- **Day 2 (Tue) — Diverge (Sketch Solutions)**: Lightning demos of comparable products; define “How Might We” opportunities; individuals sketch (notes → crazy-8s → solution sketch). **Output**: a set of solution sketches (anonymous if helpful) tied to the target moment.
- **Day 3 (Wed) — Decide & Storyboard**: Critique sketches, dot-vote, make the decision (Decider); resolve risks with “assumption busters”; create a step-by-step storyboard for the prototype. **Output**: chosen approach + storyboard + prototype scope (what’s in/out).
- **Day 4 (Thu) — Prototype**: Split roles (maker/stitcher/writer/asset-finder/interviewer); build a realistic-enough prototype; write the interview script; dry run. **Output**: clickable prototype + test plan + task scenarios.
- **Day 5 (Fri) — Test & Learn**: 5 user interviews (and/or internal stakeholders if recruiting fails); capture patterns, surprises, and decision points; debrief and decide next steps. **Output**: findings summary, validated/invalidated assumptions, prioritized next actions.

**Prep Checklist (Do Before Monday)**
- **People**: 1 Decider, 1 facilitator (you), 4–6 core participants, a couple of experts on-call; confirm attendance for all 5 days.
- **Goal & Scope**: 1–2 sentence sprint challenge, target customer segment, success metric, constraints (tech/legal/brand), what decision you must make by Friday.
- **Inputs**: Gather/print key research, analytics, support tickets, current flows/screens, roadmap context; define known unknowns.
- **Logistics**: Room/whiteboards or virtual board (Miro/FigJam), sticky notes/dots, timers, projector, snacks; clear calendar holds with start/stop times and breaks.
- **User Tests (critical)**: Recruit 5 target users for Friday (plus 2 backups), 45–60 min each; consent + NDA as needed; incentives; video call links; note-taking template.
- **Prototype Readiness**: Choose tool (Figma/Keynote/etc.), ensure accounts/access, design system/assets ready, sample copy, any fake data needed.
- **Templates**: Sprint brief, agenda per day, HMW capture sheet, sketch instructions, decision rules (who breaks ties), interview script skeleton, findings grid.

If you tell me your product area, whether it’s in-person or remote, and who the “Decider” is, I can tailor the daily agendas (timeboxes + specific exercises) and a one-page sprint brief you can send today.

**Creating a Design Sprint Plan**

The user is asking for a design sprint plan without code changes. Since no specific skills are triggered, I want to provide a concise 5-day plan that includes Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Test phases, typically structured from Monday to Friday. I’m also considering delivering daily agendas, time boxes, and a prep checklist that includes logistics, user recruitment, and materials. It would be best to include roles like Decider, facilitator, and experts and ensure it’s actionable.

**Prep Checklist**  
I’ll confirm logistics like room access, supplies, and recruit 5 users while preparing the prototype tool. I’ll definitely want to format everything neatly with headers and bullet points, keeping it concise yet thorough.
thinking
I want to structure the design sprint plan clearly by providing 2-3 bullet points for each day, focusing on objectives, activities, outputs, and artifacts. I need to outline preparation steps like creating a sprint brief, sending calendar invites, preparing data, and identifying sample users. It’s important to also include what tech setup I’ll need and sketch out a test script and prototype assets. Finally, including an end-of-day deliverable for each day is a must to keep things organized and productive.
