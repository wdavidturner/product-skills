# How to Run a Design Sprint

A Design Sprint is a 5-day process developed by Jake Knapp at Google Ventures to go from problem to tested prototype. Here's the day-by-day breakdown:

---

## Monday: Map

**Goal:** Create shared understanding and pick a target.

1. **Set a long-term goal** — Where do you want to be in 6 months to 2 years?
2. **List Sprint Questions** — What are the biggest unknowns? What could cause failure?
3. **Draw a map** — Simple flow: customers on left, goal on right, steps in between
4. **Interview experts** — Team members share what they know (capture "How Might We" notes)
5. **Pick a target** — The Decider chooses one customer and one moment to focus on

---

## Tuesday: Sketch

**Goal:** Generate solutions through individual work, not group brainstorming.

1. **Lightning Demos** (15 min) — Tour existing solutions for inspiration
2. **Four-Step Sketch:**
   - Notes (20 min): Review and jot down key info
   - Ideas (20 min): Rough sketches, ugly is fine
   - Crazy 8s (8 min): Fold paper in 8, sketch 8 variations
   - Solution Sketch (30+ min): One detailed 3-panel storyboard

**Key rule:** Sketches are anonymous and self-explanatory — no verbal pitches.

---

## Wednesday: Decide

**Goal:** Choose the best solution without endless debate.

1. **Art museum** — Tape all sketches on the wall
2. **Heat map** — Everyone silently adds dot stickers to interesting parts
3. **Speed critique** — 3 minutes per sketch: describe, call out standouts, creator clarifies
4. **Straw poll** — Each person gets one "supervote" on their favorite
5. **Decider votes** — The Decider gets 3 votes. Their choice wins.
6. **Storyboard** — Map out the prototype scene by scene (15 frames typical)

---

## Thursday: Prototype

**Goal:** Build a realistic facade — just real enough to test, fake enough to finish in one day.

**Divide roles:**
- Makers (2+): Build the screens/pages
- Stitcher (1): Combine pieces into seamless flow
- Writer (1): Write realistic copy
- Asset Collector (1): Gather images, icons, sample data
- Interviewer (1): Write the script, confirm Friday customers

**Goldilocks quality:** Real enough that customers can engage, rough enough that you can throw it away.

---

## Friday: Test

**Goal:** Learn from 5 target customers.

**Two rooms:**
- Interview room: Interviewer + customer + prototype
- Watch room: Team watches live, takes notes

**Interview structure (1 hour each):**
1. Friendly welcome (5 min)
2. Context questions (10 min)
3. Prototype introduction (5 min)
4. Tasks and reactions (30 min)
5. Debrief (5 min)

After all five interviews, identify patterns and answer your Sprint Questions.

---

## Critical Success Factors

- **Have a Decider present** — Without one, outcomes get overturned Monday
- **Recruit the right customers** — 5 target customers beats 50 random people
- **Don't group brainstorm** — Individual sketching produces better ideas
- **Prototype only the critical path** — Skip login screens, settings, edge cases
- **Test to learn, not validate** — Stay curious about unexpected reactions

---

## After the Sprint

| Outcome | Next Step |
|---------|-----------|
| Clear win | Build it with confidence |
| Partial win | Run a follow-up sprint on the parts that failed |
| Clear failure | New target, new approach, new sprint |
| Mixed signals | Look for segments that responded differently |

The book *Sprint* by Jake Knapp has the complete guide with templates and case studies.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We have a new feature idea but no one agrees on what to build. Leadership wants us to validate it fast before committing engineering resources. What's the best way to do this in a week?
```

Response:

```
Based on your situation—new feature idea with no alignment and pressure to validate quickly—I'd recommend the **Design Sprint** framework. It's specifically designed for this: align a team, prototype, and get real customer feedback in 5 days.

Let me give you a quick overview of how to run one:

## Design Sprint (5 Days)

**Day 1 - Map & Define**
- Get the right people in the room (including a Decider who can make calls)
- Map the customer journey for the problem space
- Pick a specific target: which customer and which moment to focus on

**Day 2 - Sketch Solutions**
- Everyone sketches solutions individually (no groupthink)
- Review and vote on the strongest ideas
- Decider picks direction

**Day 3 - Decide & Storyboard**
- Resolve conflicts, pick one path
- Create a detailed storyboard of the prototype experience

**Day 4 - Prototype**
- Build a realistic-looking facade (not working code)
- Aim for "Goldilocks quality"—good enough to get honest reactions

**Day 5 - Test with 5 Users**
- Watch real customers use it
- Look for patterns in reactions, confusion, and enthusiasm

## Critical Success Factors

1. **You need a Decider** - Someone with authority who participates the full week. Without them, you'll end Day 5 with no resolution.

2. **Interview users who match your target** - Testing on coworkers or the wrong segment will give you false confidence.

3. **The prototype is a facade, not a feature** - It should take 1 day to build. If you're building real code, you've missed the point.

4. **Test to learn, not to validate** - If you're just looking for "yes they liked it," you'll miss the useful feedback.

## When NOT to Use a Design Sprint

- The problem isn't well-defined yet (do customer discovery first)
- You need to optimize an existing feature (run A/B tests instead)
- The team already agrees and just needs to execute

Would you like me to walk through how to structure any specific day, or help you think through who should be in the room?

### application

Prompt:

```
I'm facilitating a design sprint next Monday. Help me plan the 5 days — what happens each day and what do I need to prepare?
```

Response:

```
Here's your 5-day Design Sprint plan:

## The Five Days

### Monday: Map
**Goal:** Create shared understanding and pick a target.

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Set long-term goal | 30 min |
| List Sprint Questions (risks, unknowns) | 30 min |
| Draw the map (customer → steps → goal) | 1 hr |
| Interview experts (team + outside), capture "How Might We" notes | 2 hrs |
| Decider picks target (one customer, one moment in the map) | 30 min |

### Tuesday: Sketch
**Goal:** Generate solutions through individual work (not brainstorming).

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Lightning Demos — tour existing solutions for inspiration | 45 min |
| Notes — review and jot down key info | 20 min |
| Ideas — rough sketches | 20 min |
| Crazy 8s — fold paper in 8, sketch 8 variations | 8 min |
| Solution Sketch — detailed 3-panel storyboard | 30+ min |

**Critical:** Solution sketches are anonymous and self-explanatory (no verbal pitches).

### Wednesday: Decide
**Goal:** Choose the best solution without endless debate.

| Activity | Time |
|----------|------|
| Art museum — tape all sketches on wall | 10 min |
| Heat map — everyone dots interesting parts silently | 15 min |
| Speed critique — 3 min per sketch | varies |
| Straw poll — each person supervotes their favorite | 10 min |
| Decider votes — their choice wins | 5 min |
| Storyboard — map prototype scene by scene (~15 frames) | 2+ hrs |

### Thursday: Prototype
**Goal:** Build a realistic facade — real enough to test, fake enough to finish in a day.

Assign roles:
- **Makers (2+):** Build prototype screens/pages
- **Stitcher (1):** Combine pieces into seamless flow
- **Writer (1):** Write realistic copy (no lorem ipsum)
- **Asset Collector (1):** Gather images, icons, data
- **Interviewer (1):** Write interview script, confirm Friday customers

End with a trial run of the whole flow.

### Friday: Test
**Goal:** Learn from 5 target customers.

| Activity | Per interview |
|----------|---------------|
| Friendly welcome | 5 min |
| Context questions | 10 min |
| Prototype introduction | 5 min |
| Tasks and reactions | 30 min |
| Debrief | 5 min |

Team watches from a second room, takes notes. After all five interviews, identify patterns across customers.

## What You Need to Prepare Before Monday

- [ ] **Decider confirmed** — The decision-maker must commit to all 5 days
- [ ] **Team assembled** — 4-7 people, cross-functional (design, eng, product, marketing, domain expert)
- [ ] **Space booked** — Dedicated room for the full week with whiteboards
- [ ] **5 target customers recruited** for Friday (plus 1-2 backups)
- [ ] **Facilitator assigned** — runs the process, doesn't pitch ideas
- [ ] **Supplies:** Post-its, dot stickers, Sharpies, paper, whiteboard markers, timer

**Common mistakes to avoid:**
- Missing Decider → sprint gets overturned Monday
- Wrong customers → feedback doesn't apply to your target market
- Skipping the map → team solves different problems all week
- Group brainstorming instead of individual sketching → shallow ideas

Would you like me to pull up any of the specific patterns for deeper guidance on a particular day?
