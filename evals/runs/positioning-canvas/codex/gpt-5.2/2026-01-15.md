Prompt:

```
How do I position my product? Walk me through a positioning framework.
```

Response:

```
A practical positioning framework is: **pick a market frame → define who it’s for → define the “job” → name the alternatives → choose your unique value → prove it → turn it into messaging**.

## 1) Choose the market frame (category)
Positioning starts by deciding what you are “a type of.”
- Options: existing category (“CRM for X”), subcategory (“AI-first CRM”), or new category (harder, only if you can teach it).
- Rule of thumb: default to an existing category unless buyers are truly confused or you win by redefining the game.

Prompt: “When someone searches/budgets for this, what line item should it map to?”

## 2) Nail the ICP (ideal customer profile)
Be specific enough that “not for you” becomes clear.
- Firmographics: industry, size, tech stack, geography, compliance needs
- Role: economic buyer, champion, end users
- Situations: triggers (new regulation, headcount freeze, migration, incident)

Prompt: “Who feels the pain weekly and has authority/budget to fix it?”

## 3) Define the job + pain (what they’re trying to accomplish)
Write it as a job statement with a measurable outcome.
- Job: “When ___, I want to ___, so I can ___.”
- Pain: cost of the status quo (time, risk, lost revenue, stress)
- Success: what “better” looks like in metrics or time-to-value

Prompt: “What would they stop doing if your product disappeared tomorrow?”

## 4) Map the competitive set (real alternatives)
Your real competitors are what the customer would do instead:
- Do nothing / accept pain
- DIY (spreadsheets, scripts, internal tools)
- Adjacent tools (piecemeal stack)
- Direct vendors

Prompt: “What are they using today, and why hasn’t it been fixed yet?”

## 5) Choose your wedge (unique value that matters)
Pick 1–2 primary differentiators that:
- matter to the ICP,
- are hard to copy quickly,
- are provable.

Common differentiator types:
- Speed/time-to-value, workflow fit, risk reduction/compliance, accuracy, cost, integration depth, automation, reliability, service model.

Prompt: “What do we do unusually well that the top alternative cannot, for this ICP?”

## 6) Add proof (reasons to believe)
Without proof, positioning is just claims.
- Quantified outcomes (before/after metrics)
- Product proof (demo moments, benchmarks)
- Credibility (logos, certifications, expert founders)
- Mechanism (why it works, not just that it works)

Prompt: “What evidence would a skeptic require to switch?”

## 7) Write the positioning (one internal source of truth)
Use a simple template (adapted from classic positioning docs):

**Positioning statement**
- For **[ICP]**
- who need **[job-to-be-done]**
- **[Product]** is a **[market category]**
- that **[primary value/outcome]**
- unlike **[primary alternative]**
- because **[key differentiator + proof]**.

Then derive messaging:
- 1-liner (website hero)
- 3 value pillars (benefits) each with proof
- key differentiators (how you do it)
- “Why now” trigger (timing)
- “Who it’s not for” (disqualifier)

## 8) Pressure-test it (so it survives reality)
Run quick tests:
- 5 customer calls: does it describe their world in their words?
- Sales objection review: does it pre-answer top doubts?
- Homepage test: can a target buyer say “this is for me” in 5 seconds?
- Competitive sanity: would a competitor honestly be able to claim the same?

Good positioning creates **clarity and tradeoffs**, not maximum appeal.

---

### A fast working session you can do in 30 minutes
1. Write ICP in one sentence.
2. List top 3 pains + current workaround.
3. Pick the #1 alternative you replace.
4. Choose 1 primary differentiator and 1 proof point.
5. Fill the positioning template.
6. Convert to a homepage hero: “Get **[outcome]** for **[ICP]** without **[pain/alternative]**.”

If you tell me your product (what it does), who you sell to, and what customers use today, I’ll draft the positioning statement + a tight messaging set (hero line + 3 pillars).

**Defining product positioning framework**

The user is looking for a general product positioning framework, so no coding or tools are needed here. I need to create a clear, concise step-by-step guide that includes context questions and core elements like target customer, problem, alternatives, value, differentiators, proof, category/market frame, messaging hierarchy, and testing/validation. It will also be good to mention common pitfalls. I'll provide a positioning statement template and possibly a worked example to make it practical. Keeping it brief is key!

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We keep losing deals to competitors even though our product is better. I think our positioning is off — we sound like everyone else. How do I differentiate?
```

Response:

```
You differentiate by *owning a specific buyer’s problem + a specific way of solving it + specific proof*, not by claiming you’re “better”.

Here’s a practical way to get there:

- **Pick one buyer + one “must-win” moment.** Choose a narrow wedge (e.g., “Security leaders at fintechs during vendor risk review” or “Ops teams when incidents spike”), not “all mid-market teams”.
- **Map the current “boring” pattern you sound like.** Collect 10 competitor homepages + 10 of your call recordings. Highlight repeated phrases (“AI-powered”, “end-to-end”, “seamless”, “modern”). Those are now banned.
- **Find your “onlyness” in 3 layers:**
  - **Enemy (what you’re against):** the default approach buyers tolerate today (spreadsheets, legacy suites, DIY, generic platforms).
  - **Mechanism (how you win):** your unique method/architecture/workflow that changes outcomes (not features).
  - **Proof (why believe you):** hard metrics, constraints you embrace, benchmarks, time-to-value, credible customer stories.
- **Write a positioning one-liner (tight and testable):**  
  `For [specific buyer] who need [critical outcome] during [trigger moment], [product] is the [category] that [unique mechanism], so they get [measurable result] without [common tradeoff].`
- **Turn it into a message hierarchy (homepage + pitch):**
  - **Primary claim:** the differentiated outcome (1 sentence).
  - **Why it’s different:** your mechanism (3 bullets).
  - **Proof:** metrics, logos with context, short case snippets, “works with/without” constraints.
  - **Who it’s for / not for:** explicit boundaries increase trust and reduce “sounds like everyone”.
- **Reframe the category if needed.** If you’re competing in a crowded category (“platform”, “AI tool”), rename the problem space you own (“incident readiness” vs “monitoring”; “contract risk clearance” vs “CLM”). Category framing is often where differentiation lives.

If you answer these 6 questions, I can help draft your positioning and a sharper pitch/website hero:
1) Who’s the economic buyer and what triggers a purchase?  
2) What do you replace most often (and why do deals stall)?  
3) Where do you consistently win (deal patterns) and lose (deal patterns)?  
4) What’s your strongest “mechanism” (the way you deliver value that others don’t)?  
5) What proof do you have (time-to-value, ROI, retention, benchmarks, case studies)?  
6) Name 2–3 competitors you lose to and what buyers say is the deciding factor.

**Providing product positioning guidance**

The user is looking for general marketing guidance without needing any coding. I should focus on frameworks, questions, steps, and messaging examples, and suggest crafting a narrative if they share more details. It’s important to be concise yet actionable. I need to cover things like competitive framing, audience segmentation, differentiation claims, and a message hierarchy. I’ll also include a "If you do nothing else" statement and ask for more information at the end.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me fill out a positioning canvas for our project management tool. We're targeting creative agencies who are frustrated with Jira. What's our competitive alternative, and how do we frame our unique value?
```

Response:

```
**Positioning Canvas (Draft)**  
- **Target customer**: Creative agencies (10–200 people) — producers/PMs, studio leads, ops — juggling many client projects, mixed disciplines (design, copy, video, web), frequent approvals, shifting priorities.  
- **Current pain (why Jira fails)**: Built for software delivery; heavy setup/admin; ticket-centric vs deliverable-centric; poor client-facing experience; hard to see “what’s shipping this week” and “who’s overloaded”; too much ceremony for creative work.  
- **Main job-to-be-done**: Plan and deliver client work from brief → production → review/approval → launch, while balancing capacity and keeping stakeholders aligned—without PM overhead.  
- **Competitive alternatives customers choose today**:  
  - **Status quo**: Jira (plus Confluence) with custom workflows.  
  - **“Work OS” PM tools**: Monday.com, Asana, ClickUp, Trello/Notion (lighter, but often need lots of tailoring).  
  - **Agency suites**: Teamwork, Productive.io, Workamajig, Function Point (deeper ops/billing, can be complex/pricey).  
  - **Ad-hoc stack**: Spreadsheets + Slack + email + Drive/Figma comments.  
- **Category (what you are)**: “Agency-first project management” (or “Creative operations platform”) — explicitly *not* an issue tracker.  
- **Unique value (the frame)**: “The no-Jira way to run creative work: deliverables + approvals + capacity, in one simple workflow.”  
- **Differentiators to lean on (pick 2–3 to lead with)**:  
  - **Deliverables-first workflow**: briefs, assets, milestones, versions—not tickets.  
  - **Client-ready collaboration**: approval rounds, feedback capture, clear status visibility without inviting clients into an internal maze.  
  - **Capacity-aware planning**: workload views that reflect creative reality (focus time, handoffs, parallel work), not just assignee fields.  
  - **Opinionated simplicity**: agency templates that work out of the box; customization where it matters, not endless configuration.  
- **Key benefit pillars (what they get)**: Fewer meetings/chasing, faster approvals, clearer priorities, predictable delivery, healthier utilization, happier clients.  
- **Reasons to believe (proof points to collect/claim)**: “Set up in a day,” templates for common agency project types, time-to-first-plan, measurable reduction in status updates, integrations they already use (Slack, Drive, Figma/Adobe, calendars), case studies.

**Competitive Alternative (how to talk about it)**  
- Use **Jira** as the “against” (frustration anchor), but position your true alternative set as: **Monday/Asana/ClickUp + agency suites**.  
- Simple framing:  
  - Jira = **dev-centric tracking** (powerful, heavy)  
  - Monday/Asana/ClickUp = **general-purpose coordination** (flexible, can become messy)  
  - Agency suites = **ops + billing heavy** (robust, complex)  
  - *You* = **creative delivery system** (brief → work → approval → ship, capacity-aware)

**Positioning Statement + Message Hooks**  
- **Positioning statement**: “For creative agencies who need to deliver client work predictably, *[Product]* is an agency-first project management tool that runs projects from brief to approval with capacity-aware planning. Unlike Jira and generic work-management tools, it’s built around deliverables, client-ready reviews, and fast setup—so teams spend less time managing and more time creating.”  
- **Tagline options**:  
  - “Run creative work. Not tickets.”  
  - “From brief to approval—minus Jira.”  
  - “Agency projects, on time and on brand.”  
- **Homepage hero (example)**: “The project management tool for creative agencies tired of Jira. Plan deliverables, manage capacity, and get approvals fast—without the overhead.”

If you tell me your top 5 features (especially around approvals, client access, resourcing, time tracking, templates, integrations) and your “we win when…” use case, I’ll tighten this into a sharper one-sentence category + 3 differentiators + a comparison table versus Jira/Monday/Productive.io.

mcp startup: no servers




thinking
**Creating a positioning canvas**

The user wants a positioning canvas without any coding. I should include elements like target customers, problems, alternatives, differentiation, key benefits, proof, and messaging. I can mention competitive alternatives like Monday.com, Asana, and Trello, especially for agencies. If it's project management for creative agencies, I need to frame it as "agency-first" with features like client approvals and creative briefs. I'll seek more details about the product name, features, and pricing to create a draft.
thinking
**Designing a Fillable Canvas**

I could incorporate headings and bullet points for clarity in the fillable canvas. It should include defined sections to make it easy to fill out. I want to highlight competitive alternatives, perhaps positioning it as "The no-Jira alternative" or an "agency-optimized work OS," especially for creative agencies. This would be in contrast to tools like Jira, Monday.com, and Asana. I think these clear distinctions will really help in guiding the user effectively!
thinking
**Crafting a Positioning Framework**

I'm looking to create a framework for creative agency project managers, producers, and ops teams, specifically for agencies with 10-200 people handling multiple client projects involving designers, copywriters, and developers. 

I see that common issues with tools like Jira include rigidity and poor visibility for clients. The jobs they need to manage include project scoping, prioritization, and client communication. 

I want to highlight unique values like a simple, visual system tailored to agencies, with built-in features for approvals and tracking. The messaging could be: “From brief to approval, without Jira.” Plus, I’ll want to list differentiation points like intuitive UX and client portals.
thinking
**Developing a Positioning Template**

I want to include a 2x2 matrix with axes representing flexibility versus opinionated and developer-centric versus creative-centric approaches. It’s crucial to add a "positioning statement" template that reads: “For [target], who [need], [product] is a [category] that [benefit]. Unlike [alternative], it [diff].” 

I’ll aim to craft the final answer with 2-3 clear headings and provide a canvas that includes both the competitive landscape and framing. This should be straightforward and effective without any coding involved!
