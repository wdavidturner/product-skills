## Positioning Framework (April Dunford)

Positioning defines how your product is **the best in the world** at delivering value that a well-defined set of customers care deeply about. It's not messaging or a tagline — it's the strategic foundation everything else builds on.

---

### The Five Components (In Order)

Work through these sequentially — each builds on the previous:

```
COMPETITIVE      →  UNIQUE        →  DIFFERENTIATED  →  TARGET        →  MARKET
ALTERNATIVES        ATTRIBUTES       VALUE              CUSTOMERS        CATEGORY

"What would         "What do we      "So what?"         "Who cares       "What context
customers do        have that                           most about       makes our value
if we didn't        they don't?"                        this value?"     obvious?"
exist?"
```

---

### Step 1: Competitive Alternatives

**Question:** What would customers do if you didn't exist?

This is NOT a list of products in your category. It includes:
- **Status quo** — spreadsheets, manual processes, interns, doing nothing
- **Shortlist alternatives** — what else lands on the evaluation list

**Key insight:** ~40% of B2B deals are lost to "no decision." You're not just competing with Zendesk; you're competing with "we'll just keep using email."

**How to find them:** Ask sales what they're displacing in every deal.

---

### Step 2: Unique Attributes (Capabilities)

**Question:** What capabilities do you have that the alternatives don't?

List everything that differentiates you:
- Features and functionality
- Pricing model
- Technology architecture
- Professional services
- Company capabilities (support, expertise, partnerships)

**Important:** These are capabilities, not value yet.

---

### Step 3: Differentiated Value

**Question:** So what? What does each capability enable for customers?

Translate capabilities into value by repeatedly asking "so what?"

**Example:**
- Capability: "Built on Salesforce"
- So what? → "Sales enablement data integrated with sales data"
- So what? → "Can measure if enablement improved time to first deal"
- So what? → **"Prove enablement ROI with actual revenue metrics"**

**The test:** If a competitor can claim the same value, it's not differentiated. "We save you time" isn't differentiated. You'll typically end up with 2-3 value themes.

---

### Step 4: Target Customers

**Question:** Who cares most about this differentiated value?

Identify characteristics that make accounts care deeply:
- Company attributes (size, industry, growth stage)
- Technology stack ("they use Salesforce")
- Team characteristics ("marketing team with 3+ people")
- Situation triggers ("just lost a client due to missed deadline")

**Important:** "Everyone" is not a target. Get specific.

---

### Step 5: Market Category

**Question:** What context makes your value obvious to your target customers?

Category helps answer "What is this thing?" When you say "CRM," customers instantly know:
- What problem it solves
- Who uses it
- What features to expect
- Who the competitors are

**How to choose:** Pick the category where your differentiated value is most obviously valuable. Sometimes existing category, sometimes subcategory, rarely a new category.

---

### Who Needs to Be in the Room

Positioning is a team sport:
- **CEO/Founder** — clearest intuition about value
- **Head of Sales** — knows what wins and loses deals
- **Head of Marketing** — translates to messaging
- **Head of Product** — knows differentiation deeply
- **Customer Success** — knows why customers stay or churn

---

### Translating to a Sales Pitch

**Setup:**
1. **Insight** — Your point of view on the market
2. **Alternative approaches** — "There's approach A (good for X, bad for Y)..."
3. **Perfect world** — "Can we agree a good solution would have A, B, C?"

**Follow-through:**
4. **Introduction** — "We're [company], [category] for [target]"
5. **Differentiated value** — Demo organized by value themes
6. **Proof** — Case studies, data
7. **Objections** — Handle silent worries
8. **The Ask** — Next step

### scenario

Prompt:

```
We keep losing deals to competitors even though our product is better. I think our positioning is off — we sound like everyone else. How do I differentiate?
```

Response:

```
Good news: "our product is better but we sound like everyone else" is a solvable problem. Here's how to approach it using April Dunford's positioning framework.

## The Core Issue

If prospects see you as interchangeable with competitors, you're likely making one of these mistakes:

1. **Claiming value that anyone can claim** — "easy to use," "saves time," "great support"
2. **Competing against the wrong alternatives** — you're positioning against named competitors when 40% of deals die to "do nothing"
3. **Listing features instead of translating to value** — customers hear what you have, not why they should care

## How to Fix It

Work through these five components **in order**:

### 1. Competitive Alternatives
Ask: *What would customers actually do if you didn't exist?*

Not just competitor products — include:
- **Status quo** (spreadsheets, manual processes, an intern)
- **Doing nothing** (living with the problem)
- **Good enough workarounds** (Slack, email, basic tools)

**Talk to sales:** What did you displace in your last 10 wins?

### 2. Unique Capabilities
List everything you have that alternatives don't:
- Features, architecture, pricing model
- Services, expertise, partnerships

### 3. Differentiated Value
For each capability, ask "so what?" until you reach customer impact:

```
Capability: "Built on Salesforce"
→ So what? "Sales data integrated automatically"
→ So what? "Can measure if enablement improved deal velocity"
→ So what? "Prove ROI with actual revenue metrics"
= Value: "The only way to prove enablement ROI with revenue data"
```

**The test:** Could a competitor put this claim on their website and have it be true? If yes, it's not differentiated.

### 4. Target Customers
Who cares *most* about this differentiated value?

Not "mid-market companies" — get specific:
- What triggers make them care? (e.g., "just lost a deal because...")
- What tech stack do they have?
- What team structure?

### 5. Market Category
What context makes your value obvious? Pick the category where your differentiation shines.

---

## Quick Diagnostic

Answer these honestly:

1. **Can your competitors claim the same value props?** If yes, you're not differentiated.
2. **Do you know what you actually beat in deals?** (Not who — what. Spreadsheets? Manual processes?)
3. **Can your sales team articulate why you vs. status quo in one sentence?**

## Positioning Canvas: PM Tool for Creative Agencies

Work through these **in order** — each builds on the previous.

### 1. Competitive Alternatives

**Question:** What would your target customers do if you didn't exist?

For creative agencies frustrated with Jira, the real alternatives are likely:

| Alternative | Why they use it |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Jira** (status quo they hate) | "It's what we have. Engineering chose it." |
| **Spreadsheets/Google Sheets** | Free, flexible, everyone knows it |
| **Monday.com / Asana** | "Prettier than Jira, marketed to us" |
| **Basecamp** | Simple, opinionated, creative-friendly |
| **Notion** | Flexible docs + databases hybrid |
| **Trello** | Visual, low friction, but outgrown |
| **Whiteboards + sticky notes** | "We're creative, we like tactile" |

**Your homework:** Ask your sales team — what do you actually displace in won deals? The answer might surprise you. "Frustrated with Jira" doesn't mean Jira is your main competitor; it might be "chaos" or "spreadsheets."

---

### 2. Unique Attributes (Capabilities)

**Question:** What do you have that those alternatives don't?

I don't know your product, but here's what typically differentiates PM tools for creative agencies:

| Capability bucket | Examples |
|-------------------|----------|
| **Visual/creative workflows** | Kanban optimized for creative reviews, visual timelines, mood board integration |
| **Client-facing features** | Branded portals, approval workflows, proof annotations |
| **Resource/capacity planning** | See who's overloaded, balance workloads across projects |
| **Creative asset integration** | Figma embeds, Adobe integration, version control for designs |
| **Simplicity** | No sprint planning, no story points, no Jira-isms |

**What's YOUR list?** Write down everything that makes you different from the alternatives above — features, pricing, support model, integrations, philosophy.

---

### 3. Differentiated Value

**Question:** So what? What does each capability *enable* for customers?

Here's where you translate capabilities into outcomes. Keep asking "so what?" until you hit business impact:

| Capability | So what? | So what? | **Differentiated Value** |
|------------|----------|----------|--------------------------|
| Visual creative workflows | Projects match how creatives think | Less context switching | **Creative teams actually use it** (vs. abandoning Jira) |
| Client approval portals | Clients give feedback in one place | Fewer email threads | **Faster approvals, happier clients** |
| No sprint points/velocity | Nothing to configure | Teams start producing in day 1 | **Zero learning curve for non-technical teams** |
| Resource planning | See utilization | Spot burnout before it happens | **Protect team capacity, hit deadlines** |

**Your differentiated value themes** will likely consolidate to 2-3 buckets. Maybe:

1. **Built for creative workflows** (not adapted from engineering tools)
2. **Client collaboration that works** (approvals, feedback, visibility)
3. **Simple enough that people actually use it** (no Jira baggage)

---

### 4. Target Customers

**Question:** Who cares *most* about that differentiated value?

Not "creative agencies" — get specific. What characteristics make an agency care deeply about your value?

| Characteristic | Why it matters |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Size: 10-50 people** | Big enough to need real PM tooling, small enough to switch easily |
| **Client work (not product)** | They need client-facing features, external approvals |
| **Design/video heavy** | Visual workflow matters more than text-based task management |
| **Already tried Jira and failed** | They know the pain, have budget, ready to switch |
| **No dedicated project manager** | Tool needs to be self-serve, not admin-heavy |
| **Growth mode** | Feeling the pain of scaling, willing to invest |

**The trigger:** "We just lost a client because we missed a deadline due to miscommunication" or "Our creatives refuse to update Jira so I have no visibility."

---

### 5. Market Category

**Question:** What context makes your value obvious to those target customers?

Options to consider:

| Category | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Project management for creative teams** | Clear, familiar, searchable | Crowded, compared to Asana/Monday |
| **Creative operations platform** | Differentiated, premium feel | May need to educate the market |
| **Agency management software** | Specific to target | Might exclude in-house creative teams |
| **Work management** | Broad, enterprise-friendly | Vague, undifferentiated |

**My suggestion:** Start with "project management for creative teams" or "creative project management" — it's a clear subcategory that instantly tells the right people "this is for me" while filtering out engineering teams looking for Jira alternatives.

---

## Putting It Together

Here's a draft positioning statement:

> **Competitive alternatives:** Jira (hated, forced on them), spreadsheets, Monday/Asana (generic), Basecamp (too simple)
>
> **Unique capabilities:** Visual workflows, client portals, creative asset integration, zero engineering baggage
>
> **Differentiated value:** The only PM tool creative teams actually use — built for visual work, client collaboration, and agencies who've outgrown spreadsheets but refuse to adopt Jira
>
> **Target customers:** Design/video agencies, 10-50 people, doing client work, who've tried and abandoned Jira or are drowning in spreadsheets
>
> **Market category:** Project management for creative teams

---

## What I Need From You

To sharpen this, tell me:

1. **What capabilities do you actually have** that alternatives don't?
2. **What do your best customers say** when asked "why did you pick us?"
3. **What do you actually beat** in won deals — Jira? Spreadsheets? Something else?

That will let us move from this draft to real positioning you can use.
