Explain Shape Up. How is it different from Scrum or Kanban?
```

Response:

```
Shape Up is a product development method from Basecamp designed to deliver meaningful bets in fixed timeboxes without a traditional backlog. It splits work into distinct phases and emphasizes shaping problems before teams commit.

**How Shape Up works (core concepts)**
- **Six-week cycles**: Teams build for ~6 weeks, then take a **cooldown** (often ~2 weeks) for bug fixes, cleanup, and shaping.
- **Shaping (up front, by senior folks)**: Someone “shapes” an idea into a solvable, bounded pitch—clarifying the problem, constraints, rabbit holes to avoid, and a rough solution approach.
- **Appetite, not estimates**: Instead of estimating “how long,” you decide **how much time you’re willing to spend** (the appetite) and shape the scope to fit.
- **Betting table**: A small group decides what to “bet” on for the next cycle; pitches either get funded or not.
- **Teams own execution**: Once a bet starts, the team has autonomy to cut scope and make tradeoffs to hit the timebox.
- **No backlog by default**: Unfunded ideas don’t pile up as “promises”; they return to the raw idea pool.
- **Progress tracking via “hill charts”**: Focus on unknowns vs. known execution work, rather than story points/burndowns.

## Different from Scrum
- **Planning/commitment**: Scrum commits every sprint (often 1–2 weeks) via sprint planning; Shape Up commits every cycle (often 6 weeks) via betting.
- **Scope management**: Scrum tends to protect sprint scope (or renegotiate); Shape Up protects the **timebox** and expects scope to be cut to fit.
- **Estimation**: Scrum commonly uses story points/velocity; Shape Up uses **appetite** and shaping to avoid detailed estimates.
- **Backlog**: Scrum is backlog-centric (grooming/refinement); Shape Up intentionally avoids a long-lived backlog.
- **Roles/ceremonies**: Scrum specifies PO/SM and recurring ceremonies; Shape Up is lighter on mandated roles/ceremonies, heavier on the quality of shaping.

## Different from Kanban
- **Cadence**: Kanban is continuous flow; Shape Up is **batch delivery in fixed cycles**.
- **Work selection**: Kanban pulls from a prioritized queue with WIP limits; Shape Up “bets” on a small set of shaped pitches per cycle.
- **Managing uncertainty**: Kanban optimizes flow predictability; Shape Up front-loads uncertainty reduction through shaping, then expects teams to adjust scope inside the timebox.
- **Backlog/queue**: Kanban typically uses an ongoing queue; Shape Up prefers an idea pool + periodic betting rather than a committed queue.

In short: **Scrum** optimizes iterative delivery with roles/ceremonies and estimation; **Kanban** optimizes continuous flow with WIP limits; **Shape Up** optimizes for high-leverage bets by shaping work to fit a fixed appetite and giving teams autonomy to cut scope to ship on time.

### scenario

Prompt:

```
Our sprints feel like a treadmill — we ship increments but never finish anything meaningful. How do we change our process to ship complete features?
```

Response:

```
To stop “shipping increments” and start shipping complete features, you need to change what you plan, what counts as done, and how much you run in parallel.

- Redefine **Done**: “done” = in production (or released behind a flag), accepted by PO/users, monitored, documented, and supportable—not “code merged” or “QA passed”.
- Plan by **feature**, execute by **thin vertical slices**: each sprint item should be a slice that touches UI + backend + data + tests and is shippable end-to-end; avoid horizontal tasks like “API part 1”.
- Limit **WIP hard**: cap active features to 1 (or 2 max) per team; if something new appears, it replaces something—“stop starting, start finishing”.
- Make integration/release work non-optional: include testing, hardening, analytics, rollout, migration, and comms as part of each slice; no “integration sprint” at the end.
- Change the sprint “contract”: only commit to work that can reach the new DoD; reserve capacity (e.g., 20–30%) for interrupts and finishing work (bugs, edge cases, rollout issues).
- Review only shipped value: in sprint review, demo only what’s actually released; track % of sprint work that reached DoD and feature lead time to production.

If you answer these, I can tailor the process: (1) how many features/epics are typically in-flight per team right now, (2) what does “done” mean today, (3) what usually blocks release (QA, dependencies, approvals, rollout risk, unclear acceptance)?

thinking
**Providing process advice**

I see this isn't a coding task, and no specific skills are needed, just process advice. I'll outline a concise framework: defining feature vertical slices, ensuring a clear definition of done, WIP limits, and outcome-based planning—basically focusing on small batch sizes and cross-functional teamwork. I’ll mention potential scrum anti-patterns, propose changes like a single team goal, and recommend a "feature completion board" for tracking progress. Planning fewer items in sprints and including integration tasks is also essential.
thinking
**Proposing process improvements**

I'm focusing on using "thin vertical slices" and "walking skeletons" while measuring key metrics like lead time to production, work completion percentage, and defect rates. I think we should conduct a "finish line" demo that showcases only delivered features and have sprint reviews that emphasize outcomes. By creating a weekly release cadence and using feature flags, we can separate deployment and release. I’ll propose a 30-day experiment with structured steps that include redefining "done" to encompass production, planning at the feature level, and limiting WIP.
thinking
**Shifting to effective processes**

I think we should implement feature flags, trunk-based development, and CI/CD to improve our process. Tracking metrics can help identify common issues like too many stakeholders or a lack of product owner sign-off. I suggest creating a process template that includes a feature backlog of slices and a Definition of Done checklist. Setting up a Feature Kanban with a WIP limit of 1-2 is also important. We could craft a final answer with concise steps for a 2-week experiment while asking a few key questions to engage the team.
thinking
**Suggesting process changes**

The user is asking how to change the current process, so I need to provide tailored suggestions and clarifying questions. First, I’d recommend changing our planning unit from stories to "feature slices that can ship." We should establish a Definition of Done that requires features to be in production, monitored, documented, and ready for support. Limiting Work In Progress to 1-2 active features is essential. Also, we should only commit to slices that can reach the Definition of Done and track metrics for adjustments.

### application

Prompt:

```
Help me shape a project using Shape Up. We want to add team workspaces to our app. How do I write a pitch with the right level of abstraction — shaped but not over-specified?
```

Response:

```
A Shape Up pitch should “shape the work” by locking in the problem, appetite, constraints, and a *high-level* solution concept—while leaving room for the team to figure out the exact UI details, data model details, and task breakdown during the cycle.

**How to stay shaped (not over-specified)**
- Write in terms of *user-facing capabilities and key flows*, not screens, components, or tickets.
- Specify *hard boundaries* (“must/never”) and *success criteria* (“done means…”), but avoid pixel-perfect UX, edge-case exhaustiveness, and implementation choices.
- Include 1–3 “fat marker” sketches/breadboards showing navigation + objects (Workspace → People → Settings), not final layouts.
- Call out *rabbit holes* and add circuit breakers (“if SSO integration exceeds 1 week, ship without it”).
- Keep scope driven by the *appetite* (e.g., 4–6 weeks): ship the smallest coherent version that creates the new “team” unit.

## Pitch template (copy/paste)
**Title**: Team Workspaces (v1)

**Problem**
- What’s broken today for teams? (sharing, permissions, ownership, billing, separation)
- Who feels it, and when?

**Appetite**
- `X weeks` (fixed). This is a bet, not a backlog.

**Solution (high level)**
- Introduce a *Workspace* as the top-level container for people + projects + settings.
- Core flows:
  - Create workspace (personal → team)
  - Invite members, accept invite
  - Switch workspace / see current workspace context
  - Workspace-level roles/permissions (coarse-grained)
- Key UI surfaces (breadboard-level): workspace switcher, members page, workspace settings, invite acceptance.

**Scope / No-gos (explicit boundaries)**
- In: basic roles (e.g., Owner/Admin/Member), invites, workspace switch, workspace-scoped data.
- Not in (v1): SSO/SCIM, granular per-project permissions, multi-workspace analytics, complex org hierarchy, audit logs, advanced billing proration.

**Data & behavior rules (just enough)**
- “Most things belong to a workspace” (name the few exceptions).
- Defaults/migration: existing accounts become a personal workspace; upgrade path to team workspace.
- Sharing model: items are visible within a workspace (don’t enumerate every permission).

**Risks / Rabbit holes**
- Migration/backfill performance
- Cross-workspace access leaks
- Invite edge cases (expired, reused email, domains)
- Billing alignment (if applicable)

**Circuit breakers**
- If migration is too risky → start with “new workspaces only,” migrate later.
- If roles get contentious → ship 2 roles (Owner/Member) first.

**Definition of done (testable outcomes)**
- A team can create a workspace, invite 3 people, collaborate with workspace-scoped data, and switch contexts without confusion.
- Support can answer “who has access?” from within the workspace members page.

## Quick self-check: “Is this over-specified?”
- If you can turn your pitch into a Jira task list without decisions left, it’s too detailed.
- If the team could implement 3 different reasonable UIs from it, it’s probably the right level.
- If success can’t be verified by running the product, it’s too vague.

If you tell me your cycle appetite (2/4/6 weeks) and what your app’s “thing” is (projects? documents? dashboards?), I can draft a concrete v1 pitch tailored to your domain.

**Creating Shape Up Pitch Guidance**

I need to create a response about the Shape Up pitch that doesn't require coding. I should provide a template that includes essential elements like appetite, boundaries, and solution sketches, using "fat marker" style. This should be concise but informative.

I want to mention important aspects like scoping and using minimal UI sketches. I should give tips on stating the problem, defining constraints, and describing how the solution works without getting into specifics. In my sample sections, I'll include key decisions, such as workspace models and membership roles, and I’ll use an example to illustrate the right level of abstraction. Finally, I'll provide questions to ensure clarity.
thinking
**Building a Shape Up Pitch Template**

I need to include elements like "risks and unknowns" and "circuit breakers" in my response. It sounds like I should structure this with around 6-10 bullet points, possibly using sections like Pitch Anatomy, Guidance, and Example Outline. I'll aim to keep it concise, maybe within 10 lines, but it seems the user might need more detail.

While I want to avoid over-verbosity, it's important to include enough meaningful content. I’ll create one clear template with sample content, without relying on any tools.
