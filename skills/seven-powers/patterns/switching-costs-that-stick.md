## Switching Costs That Actually Stick

Not all switching costs create durable power. Competitors actively work to reduce your switching costs with migration tools, data portability, and onboarding assistance. Only switching costs that are structural — not just frictional — create lasting power.

**Incorrect (assuming all friction is power):**

> **Product Strategy Meeting:**
>
> "Our switching costs are significant:
> - Customers have 2+ years of historical data in our system
> - Users have learned our interface and workflows
> - Migrating to a competitor would take weeks
>
> These switching costs lock customers in."

**Correct (testing switching cost durability):**

> **Product Strategy Meeting:**
>
> "Let's assess which switching costs are durable:
>
> **Data migration costs:**
> - Current: Takes 2-3 weeks to export and import
> - Risk: Competitor just launched 'one-click migration tool'
> - Risk: New data portability regulations coming
> - Assessment: Frictional, not structural. Will erode.
>
> **Learning curve:**
> - Current: Average user takes 2 weeks to be productive
> - Risk: Competitor UX is simpler, faster to learn
> - Risk: Users change jobs and take preferences with them
> - Assessment: Frictional, partially durable
>
> **Workflow integrations:**
> - Current: Average customer has 5+ integrations configured
> - Risk: Competitors building integration importers
> - Assessment: Moderate durability
>
> **What's actually structural:**
> - Customer-specific configurations and customizations
> - Institutional knowledge embedded in their setup
> - Integration with customer's unique internal systems
> - Multi-user coordination (everyone has to switch together)
>
> **Action plan:**
> - Double down on deep customization features
> - Build integration ecosystem that's hard to replicate
> - Create team-based features that create coordination costs
> - Don't rely on data hostage-taking — it's temporary and creates ill will"

**Types of switching costs by durability:**

| Type | Durability | Can Be Attacked By |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Data lock-in | Low | Migration tools, data portability laws |
| Learning curve | Low-Medium | Better UX, similar interfaces |
| Financial (contracts) | Medium | Buy-out offers, discounts |
| Integration complexity | Medium-High | Integration platforms, but costly |
| Multi-user coordination | High | Very difficult to overcome |
| Embedded institutional knowledge | High | Takes years to rebuild |

**Why it matters:**

Switching costs only create power when they persist. A competitor saying "we'll migrate you for free in 24 hours" can nullify years of data lock-in instantly. Build switching costs that can't be easily dissolved by a clever competitor offer.

**Test:** For each switching cost you cite, ask: "What would a competitor need to offer to make customers willing to switch?" If the answer is "a modest discount" or "free migration," it's not durable power.
