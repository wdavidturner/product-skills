## Brand Recognition Is Not Branding Power

Many companies confuse brand recognition (people know who you are) with branding power (people will pay more for an identical product). Recognition can be bought with advertising. Power must be earned over time.

**Incorrect (claiming brand recognition as power):**

> **Board Meeting — Competitive Position:**
>
> "Our brand strength is a key differentiator:
> - 78% aided brand awareness in target market
> - 4.2M social media followers
> - Featured in TechCrunch, WSJ, and Forbes
> - Top-of-funnel recall in customer surveys
>
> Our brand power creates a sustainable moat."

All of this measures recognition, not power. You could achieve this by buying a Super Bowl ad and hiring a good PR firm.

**Correct (distinguishing recognition from power):**

> **Board Meeting — Competitive Position:**
>
> "Let's distinguish brand recognition from branding power:
>
> **What we have (recognition):**
> - High awareness — people know our name
> - Positive sentiment — people like what they've heard
> - This is valuable but not a moat
>
> **The branding power test:**
> Would customers pay a premium for our product over an objectively identical competitor product?
>
> **Tiffany Test:** If we sold an identical product in a plain box, would customers pay the same?
> - If yes → we don't have branding power
> - If no → the delta is our branding power
>
> **Our assessment:**
> - In head-to-head comparisons with identical feature sets, we win on brand preference
> - BUT customers aren't willing to pay more than 5-10% premium
> - Conclusion: Modest brand advantage, not material branding power
>
> **Why we don't have branding power yet:**
> - We're 6 years old — branding power requires sustained presence
> - Our category has functional purchase decisions (not emotional)
> - Customers can easily evaluate quality objectively
>
> **Our actual moats:** Scale economies, switching costs — not branding"

**When branding power exists:**

| Category | Branding Power? | Why? |
|----------|----------------|------|
| Tiffany engagement rings | Yes | Emotional purchase, hard to evaluate objectively, heritage matters |
| Apple consumer electronics | Yes | Status signaling, design consistency over decades |
| Coca-Cola | Yes | Taste is subjective, nostalgia, century of consistency |
| B2B SaaS | Usually no | Functional purchase, features are comparable, no status signal |
| Commodities with clear specs | No | Objective comparison possible |

**Why it matters:**

Hamilton Helmer specifically calls this out: "People sometimes think they have branding power... but you can get brand recognition by buying an ad in the Super Bowl. That's not power, that you paid for it."

Branding power is a late-stage phenomenon that emerges from decades of consistent customer experience. Early-stage companies have recognition (maybe), not power.
