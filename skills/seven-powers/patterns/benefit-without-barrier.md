## A Castle Without a Moat Gets Stormed

Power requires both a benefit (you're better) AND a barrier (competitors can't copy). Many companies have real advantages that create no durable value because there's nothing preventing imitation.

**Incorrect (benefit without barrier):**

> **Strategy Review Meeting:**
>
> "We have significant competitive advantage:
> - Our recommendation algorithm is 15% more accurate than competitors
> - We've built integrations with 200+ tools in our ecosystem
> - Our mobile app has the highest ratings in the category
>
> These advantages prove we have strong market position."

**Analysis of each claim:**

| Claimed Benefit | Barrier? |
|-----------------|----------|
| 15% better algorithm | No — competitors can improve theirs, hire our engineers, buy same training data |
| 200+ integrations | Weak — competitors can build integrations too (maybe takes 18 months) |
| Highest app ratings | No — UI/UX is visible and imitable |

**Correct (testing for barriers):**

> **Strategy Review Meeting:**
>
> "Let's apply the benefit + barrier test to our claimed advantages:
>
> **Recommendation algorithm:** Benefit is real (15% better), but no barrier. A funded competitor could match this in 12-18 months. Not power.
>
> **Integrations:** Benefit is real, barrier is weak. However, if our integrations create switching costs for customers (they've configured complex workflows), that *is* power — but the power is switching costs, not the integrations themselves.
>
> **App ratings:** Benefit is real, no barrier. Not power.
>
> **What we actually have:**
> - Switching costs from workflow configurations (power)
> - Modest scale economies from our data labeling costs (power if material)
> - Operational excellence in product development (necessary, not power)"

**Why it matters:**

Warren Buffett looks for "economic castles protected by unbreachable moats." A castle without a moat is just a building someone else can take. Every benefit you cite must pass the barrier test: What specifically prevents a well-funded competitor from replicating this within 2-3 years?
