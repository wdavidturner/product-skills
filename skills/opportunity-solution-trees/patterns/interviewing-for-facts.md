## Collect Stories, Not Facts

Asking direct questions yields surface-level facts. Collecting stories reveals context, emotion, and needs customers don't even know they have. Your interviews should feel like a conversation, not an interrogation.

**Incorrect (fact-gathering interview):**

> **Interviewer:** "What do you like about Netflix?"
>
> **Customer:** "The recommendations are pretty good."
>
> **Interviewer:** "How do you decide what to watch?"
>
> **Customer:** "I usually just browse around."
>
> **Interviewer:** "Do you use the search feature?"
>
> **Customer:** "Sometimes."
>
> *Result:* A list of facts that reveal nothing. "Recommendations are good" doesn't tell you what job they're doing. "Browse around" doesn't tell you what's frustrating. You've confirmed features exist, not discovered opportunities.

**Correct (story-gathering interview):**

> **Interviewer:** "Tell me about the last time you watched something on a streaming service. Set the scene — where were you?"
>
> **Customer:** "It was last night, around 8pm. I was on the couch, pretty tired after dinner."
>
> **Interviewer:** "Walk me through what happened next."
>
> **Customer:** "Well, I opened Netflix first, scrolled around for like 10 minutes, didn't find anything. Then I tried Prime, same thing. I was about to give up when I remembered someone at work mentioned Obi-Wan, so I went to Disney+."
>
> **Interviewer:** "You mentioned you scrolled on Netflix for 10 minutes. Tell me more about that."
>
> **Customer:** "It's frustrating. I see the same stuff every time. Nothing new catches my eye. And I can't tell if the new shows are any good just from the thumbnail..."
>
> *Result:* Real opportunities emerge: decision fatigue, stale recommendations, inability to evaluate quality. You heard things the customer wouldn't have mentioned if you'd asked directly.

**Why it matters:**

The story contains the job. Direct questions trigger the rational brain, which gives you neat explanations that don't reflect actual behavior. "What happened next?" keeps them in memory mode, where the truth lives.
