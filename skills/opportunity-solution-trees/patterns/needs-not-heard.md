## Hear the Needs Customers Don't State

Customers rarely tell you their needs directly. They tell you stories. The needs are embedded in what they describe — the workarounds, the hesitations, the compromises. You have to train your ear to hear them.

**Incorrect (only hearing explicit needs):**

> **Interview excerpt:**
>
> **Interviewer:** "Tell me about the last time you used the app."
>
> **Customer:** "I opened it, scrolled for a while, then just put on The Office again since I've seen it before."
>
> **Post-interview notes:** "Customer likes rewatching familiar shows."
>
> *Result:* You recorded what they said, but missed what they meant. Why did they scroll "for a while"? Why did they default to a rewatch? There are unspoken needs hiding in that story.

**Correct (hearing implicit needs):**

> **Interview excerpt:**
>
> **Interviewer:** "Tell me about the last time you used the app."
>
> **Customer:** "I opened it, scrolled for a while, then just put on The Office again since I've seen it before."
>
> **Interviewer:** "You mentioned you scrolled for a while. Tell me more about that."
>
> **Customer:** "Yeah, I was looking but nothing stood out. I was kind of tired and didn't want to think too hard. With The Office, I know what I'm getting."
>
> **Post-interview notes:**
> - **Implicit need:** Low cognitive effort selection when tired
> - **Implicit need:** Confidence in what they'll get (no disappointment risk)
> - **Opportunity:** "I don't want to think hard about what to watch"
> - **Opportunity:** "I'm afraid of wasting time on something I won't like"
>
> *Result:* You heard needs the customer didn't explicitly state. They didn't say "I need low-effort choices" — they said they were tired and defaulted to comfort. Same data, deeper insight.

**Why it matters:**

Customers don't know their needs in product language. They describe behavior. Your job is translation: "I just put on The Office" becomes "I need guaranteed satisfaction when I'm too tired to evaluate options." This is the skill that separates good discovery from survey data.
