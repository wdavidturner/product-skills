## You Can't Hypothesize Opportunities in a Conference Room

Teams that skip customer research and brainstorm opportunities internally will be wrong. The value of the OST is surfacing the irrational, contextual needs that only emerge from real customer stories.

**Incorrect (conference room opportunities):**

> **Team Workshop Output:**
>
> "Based on our experience with the product and industry knowledge, we believe our customers' key opportunities are:
> 1. Need to save time on repetitive tasks
> 2. Want better collaboration with teammates
> 3. Need visibility into project status
> 4. Want mobile access
>
> Let's prioritize these and start building!"
>
> *Result:* Generic opportunities that could apply to any SaaS product. No context, no emotional texture, no insight into what actually drives behavior. You built for jobs you imagined, not jobs that exist.

**Correct (research-based opportunities):**

> **Post-Interview Findings (12 interviews):**
>
> "We heard several unexpected patterns:
>
> **Top opportunity:** 'I just got promoted and inherited a disaster. I need to look competent fast before anyone notices I have no idea what's going on.'
>
> **Second opportunity:** 'We lost a client because things fell through the cracks. My boss said fix it or I'm out.'
>
> **Surprising pattern:** No one mentioned 'collaboration' as a need. They care about not getting blamed when things go wrong.
>
> **Context we missed:** Most switching happens after a crisis, not during gradual dissatisfaction."
>
> *Result:* Emotional, contextual, specific opportunities. The team now understands why people actually buy — and it's not "save time."

**Why it matters:**

Your team knows your product. Your team does not know your customers' lives. The opportunities that drive purchases are surprising, emotional, and context-specific. You cannot guess them. You must discover them.
