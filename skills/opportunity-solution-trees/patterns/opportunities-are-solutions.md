## Opportunities Are Not Solutions

98% of teams write solutions in their opportunity space. An opportunity is a customer need, pain point, or desire — NOT how you'll fix it. Getting this wrong means your whole tree is built on sand.

**Incorrect (solutions disguised as opportunities):**

> **Product Team's Opportunity Space:**
>
> - Add a search bar
> - Create filtering options
> - Build a mobile app
> - Implement push notifications
> - Add social sharing
>
> *Result:* The team debates which "opportunity" to tackle first, but they're really just arguing about which feature to build. No shared understanding of customer needs. No way to know if they're solving the right problem.

**Correct (actual opportunities):**

> **Product Team's Opportunity Space:**
>
> - I can't find what I'm looking for
> - There are too many options and I feel overwhelmed
> - I want to use this when I'm not at my desk
> - I forget to come back and things fall through the cracks
> - I want my friends to know about this
>
> *Result:* Now the team can generate multiple solutions for each opportunity. "I can't find what I'm looking for" could be solved by search, better navigation, favorites, recent items, or improved categorization. Comparing solutions reveals trade-offs.

**Why it matters:**

If Netflix and Hulu both serve streaming customers, their opportunity spaces should look nearly identical — the human needs are the same. The solutions will differ. When your opportunities read like feature specs, you've skipped the most important step: understanding what customers actually need.
