## Hiring a Growth Team Too Early

You can't outsource product-market fit to a growth team. If your product doesn't retain users organically, a growth team will just accelerate the churn.

**Incorrect (growth team to solve PMF):**

> **Startup Situation:**
>
> - 1,000 signups/month
> - 5% week-1 retention
> - Users complain the product doesn't solve their problem
> - Founders: "We need a growth team to fix this"
>
> **What happens:**
> - Growth team runs acquisition experiments: signups go from 1,000 to 2,000
> - Growth team optimizes onboarding: week-1 retention goes from 5% to 7%
> - Revenue barely moves
> - Growth team burns out trying to push water uphill
>
> *Result:* Growth team leaves. Founders blame execution. Real problem (product doesn't work) remains unfixed.

**Correct (growth team after PMF):**

> **Startup Situation:**
>
> - 500 signups/month
> - 35% week-1 retention
> - Users actively recommend product to peers
> - Founders have closed first 50 customers themselves
>
> **Now hire growth:**
> - Growth team increases signups: 500 → 1,500
> - Growth team optimizes activation: 35% → 50%
> - Revenue 3x in one quarter
>
> *Result:* Growth team accelerates working motion. Every optimization multiplies.

**Why it matters:**

Growth teams are accelerants, not fixers. If you're pouring more users into a leaky bucket, growth will just make the leak more expensive. Wait until you have organic retention (users staying without being pushed) before investing in dedicated growth resources.
