## Choosing Trial vs. Freemium Wrong

Free trial and freemium serve different purposes. Picking the wrong model for your product leads to either low reach or low conversion.

**Incorrect (freemium for complex product):**

> **Enterprise Security Tool:**
>
> "Let's do freemium to maximize reach. Free tier gets basic scanning, paid gets advanced features."
>
> **Problem:** Basic scanning alone is worthless — users need to see the full picture (vulnerabilities, prioritization, remediation) to understand value. The free tier doesn't demonstrate anything useful.
>
> **Result:** Users sign up, run basic scan, see nothing actionable, leave. Never understood what the product could do.

**Incorrect (free trial for viral product):**

> **Collaboration Whiteboard:**
>
> "Let's do 14-day free trial to drive urgency."
>
> **Problem:** Product's main value is viral spread — users invite teammates, who invite more teammates. A 14-day clock kills this motion before it can grow.
>
> **Result:** Users invite a few people, trial expires before network effects kick in, team abandons product.

**Correct (matching model to product):**

> **Enterprise Security Tool:** 30-day free trial with full features
> - Users see complete value in trial period
> - Clear proof-of-concept workflow guides evaluation
> - Trial creates urgency: "Budget this quarter or lose access"
>
> **Collaboration Whiteboard:** Freemium with feature limits
> - Free tier enables viral growth (invite unlimited users)
> - Usage limits (boards, storage) create upgrade pressure
> - No time pressure — let the network build
>
> **Hybrid option:** Freemium for individuals, free trial for team evaluation
> - GitLab: Free forever for personal use, 30-day trial for enterprise features
> - Best of both: broad reach AND clear enterprise evaluation path

**Why it matters:**

Trial = urgency, full-feature evaluation, shorter sales cycles. Freemium = reach, network effects, longer time-to-value. Neither is universally better. Match the model to how your product delivers value.
