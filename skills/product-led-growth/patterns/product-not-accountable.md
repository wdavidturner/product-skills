## Product Not Accountable for PLG Metrics

PLG fails when product teams treat it as a marketing or sales initiative. If product isn't accountable for activation, conversion, and pipeline creation, PLG becomes a side project that nobody owns.

**Incorrect (PLG as a marketing initiative):**

> **Org Structure:**
>
> - Marketing owns: signups, MQLs, website conversion
> - Sales owns: pipeline, revenue
> - Product owns: feature delivery, NPS, user satisfaction
>
> **PLG Initiative:** Marketing launches free trial. Product builds the features. Marketing tries to convert free users to paid with email campaigns.
>
> *Result:* Marketing can't fix product friction. Product doesn't care about conversion rates. Free users pile up, nobody converts, marketing blames product, product says "we shipped what you asked for."

**Correct (product owns monetization metrics):**

> **Org Structure:**
>
> - Marketing owns: signup quality, growth marketing
> - Sales owns: enterprise pipeline (from PQAs), revenue
> - Product/Growth owns: activation rate, free-to-paid conversion, PQA creation, self-serve revenue
>
> **PLG Initiative:** Growth PM leads with revenue accountability. Engineering is dedicated to growth squad. Product leadership is measured on self-serve ARR alongside core product metrics.
>
> *Result:* When conversion drops, product investigates and fixes. Activation experiments run weekly. Product and sales have regular PQA reviews. Pipeline is predictable.

**Why it matters:**

The worst thing you can do is say "I'm going to do PLG" and put it in marketing. Recipe for disaster. Product must take accountability for selling the product itself. This is uncomfortable for many product teams who've never owned monetization, but it's non-negotiable for PLG success.
