## PLG Requires an Individual Use Case First

PLG starts with an individual solving their own problem. If your product only delivers value at the team or company level, users have no reason to sign up and explore on their own.

**Incorrect (launching PLG without individual value):**

> **Enterprise Analytics Platform Launch Plan:**
>
> "We're adding a free tier to compete with Amplitude. Users can sign up and explore our dashboards. The value is in cross-departmental data insights and company-wide analytics governance."
>
> *Result:* Users sign up, see an empty dashboard, and leave. They can't experience value without their entire org's data instrumented. Activation rate: 3%.

**Correct (building from individual to enterprise):**

> **Enterprise Analytics Platform Launch Plan:**
>
> "Users sign up and immediately get a personal analytics workspace. They can track their own product's events, build dashboards for their team, and see insights within minutes. As usage grows, we show the value of connecting with other teams' data."
>
> Individual job: "I need data to make better decisions for my feature"
> Team job: "My squad needs shared visibility into our metrics"
> Enterprise job: "We need a data-driven culture across the company"
>
> *Result:* Users sign up, instrument their own product, and see value in hours. When 7+ users from the same company are active, sales engages about enterprise capabilities.

**Why it matters:**

PLG is an escalator: individual problem → team problem → enterprise problem. Without the first step, no one boards the escalator. You can't skip to enterprise value with a free tier — that's just sales-led with an extra signup form.
