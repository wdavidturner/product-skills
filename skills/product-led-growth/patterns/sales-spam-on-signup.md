## Sales Spam on Signup — Users Are Not MQLs

A new signup is not a Marketing Qualified Lead. They came to solve an individual problem, not buy an enterprise solution. Treating them like MQLs destroys the user experience and poisons the sales channel.

**Incorrect (applying top-down sales playbook to PLG signups):**

> **Sales Workflow:**
>
> User signs up for free account → 10 minutes later, receives email: "Hi! I noticed you just signed up for [Product]. I'd love to schedule 15 minutes to learn about your use case and show you how companies like yours are saving 40% on..."
>
> User has used product for 3 minutes. Hasn't even completed onboarding.
>
> *User thinking:* "I just wanted to try this. Why am I being stalked? This is creepy."
>
> *Result:* User ignores all future emails from your domain. When they ARE ready to buy 6 months later, your channel is burned.

**Correct (engaging based on usage signals):**

> **Sales Workflow:**
>
> User signs up → product onboards them → user invites teammates → usage grows → 7+ users from company, core features heavily used, admin reviews Terms of Service page
>
> NOW sales reaches out: "Hi! I noticed your team has been using [Product] heavily over the past few weeks. A few companies your size have questions about enterprise security and SSO at this stage. Would it be helpful to chat about those, or is there something else I can help with?"
>
> *User thinking:* "Actually, yes — I was just about to look into SSO. This is helpful."
>
> *Result:* Sales outreach adds value. User sees sales as a resource, not a pest.

**Why it matters:**

In top-down sales, an MQL is already in consideration for an enterprise solution. In PLG, a new signup is solving a personal problem — they're at the very top of a different funnel. Reaching out 10 minutes after signup is like proposing marriage on a first date. Match your outreach to where the user actually is in their journey.
