## Freemium That Satisfies Instead of Creates Demand

A free tier should make users hungry for more. If free satisfies their entire need, they have no reason to pay.

**Incorrect (free tier too generous):**

> **Collaboration Tool Pricing:**
>
> **Free:** Unlimited boards, unlimited collaborators, all core features, 100GB storage
> **Pro ($12/mo):** Advanced permissions, audit logs, priority support
>
> *User thinking:* "I get everything I need for free. Why would I pay $12/mo for 'advanced permissions' I don't understand?"
>
> *Result:* 0.5% conversion rate. Massive free user base generating no revenue. Board decided to add ads to free tier.

**Correct (free creates hunger for paid):**

> **Collaboration Tool Pricing:**
>
> **Free:** 3 boards, up to 5 collaborators, core features, 1GB storage
> **Pro ($12/mo):** Unlimited boards, unlimited collaborators, templates library, 100GB storage
>
> *User thinking:* "I hit my 3 board limit. This tool is amazing but I need more space. $12/mo is a no-brainer."
>
> *Result:* 7% conversion rate. Free users organically upgrade as they hit natural limits. Sales contacts high-usage accounts for enterprise.

**Why it matters:**

Free should be a taste, not the meal. The goal is for users to hit friction points that make them *want* to pay — not friction that annoys them, but friction that shows them the value they're missing. Generous free tiers feel good but destroy unit economics.
