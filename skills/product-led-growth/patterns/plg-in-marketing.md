## Running PLG from Marketing

PLG requires product changes to succeed. Marketing can drive signups, but they can't fix activation friction, improve time-to-value, or optimize the in-product upgrade experience. When PLG lives in marketing, it fails.

**Incorrect (marketing owns PLG):**

> **Org Structure:**
>
> VP Marketing launches "PLG Initiative"
> - Marketing designs free trial landing pages
> - Marketing builds email nurture campaigns for free users
> - Marketing requests features from product (low priority)
> - Marketing can't access usage data easily
>
> **6 months later:**
> - Signups are up (marketing did their job)
> - Activation is flat (product friction unchanged)
> - Conversion is flat (in-product experience unchanged)
> - Marketing is frustrated: "Product won't prioritize our requests"
> - Product is frustrated: "Marketing keeps asking for random stuff"

**Correct (product owns PLG with marketing partnership):**

> **Org Structure:**
>
> Growth PM (in Product org) owns PLG motion
> - Growth PM owns activation rate, conversion rate, self-serve revenue
> - Growth PM has dedicated engineering resources
> - Growth PM has direct access to usage data
> - Marketing partners on acquisition and growth marketing
> - Regular syncs between Growth PM and Growth Marketing lead
>
> **6 months later:**
> - Activation improvements shipped weekly
> - Conversion experiments running constantly
> - Signups AND conversion both improving
> - Clear accountability and fast iteration

**Why it matters:**

Marketing can bring users to the door, but only product can make them stay. PLG is fundamentally about the in-product experience. If marketing owns it, they're accountable for outcomes they can't control. Product must own PLG — the changes happen in the product.
