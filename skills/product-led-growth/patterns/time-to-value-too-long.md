## Time to Value Too Long

If users can't see value in their first session, they won't come back for a second. PLG products need to deliver aha moments in minutes, not days.

**Incorrect (value requires too much setup):**

> **Developer Tool Onboarding:**
>
> 1. Sign up (2 min)
> 2. Create organization (1 min)
> 3. Connect GitHub repository (5 min)
> 4. Configure CI pipeline (15 min)
> 5. Wait for first build to run (10 min)
> 6. Read documentation to understand results (20 min)
>
> Time to value: ~53 minutes minimum
>
> **User thinking at step 4:** "I don't have time for this right now. I'll come back later."
>
> *Result:* 70% drop-off before value. Users who drop off rarely return.

**Correct (immediate value with progressive depth):**

> **Developer Tool Onboarding:**
>
> 1. Sign up (2 min)
> 2. See instant demo with sample repository already connected, build already run, results already displayed
> 3. Explore the results, understand what the tool does (5 min)
> 4. Optional: Connect your own repo when ready
>
> Time to value: ~7 minutes
>
> **User thinking:** "Oh, I get it now. This is cool. Let me try it on my actual project."
>
> *Result:* 40% reach aha moment. Many convert before ever connecting their own code.

**Why it matters:**

"Do > Show > Tell." Give users a warm start with sample data, templates, or pre-configured environments. Let them experience value before asking them to invest effort. The first session is everything in PLG — if they don't see value, your marketing dollars are wasted.
