## Ignoring Activation — The Biggest PLG Lever

Most PLG teams obsess over acquisition (more signups) or conversion (better pricing pages). But the biggest lever is usually activation — getting users who sign up to actually experience value.

**Incorrect (focusing everywhere except activation):**

> **Growth Team Q3 Roadmap:**
>
> - SEO improvements to drive more organic signups
> - Pricing page A/B tests to improve conversion
> - Email sequences to re-engage dormant users
> - New affiliate program launch
>
> **Funnel metrics:**
> - Signups/month: 10,000
> - Activated (used core feature): 800 (8%)
> - Converted to paid: 80 (10% of activated)
>
> *Result:* Team spends quarter optimizing top-of-funnel. Signups increase 20%. Revenue increases 2%.

**Correct (prioritizing activation):**

> **Growth Team Q3 Roadmap:**
>
> - Define activation metric: "Created first project with 2+ items in 7 days"
> - Build onboarding flow with sample data users can play with immediately
> - Add contextual tooltips at common drop-off points
> - Trigger email if user abandons before activation
>
> **Funnel metrics before:**
> - Signups: 10,000 → Activated: 800 (8%) → Paid: 80
>
> **Funnel metrics after:**
> - Signups: 10,000 → Activated: 2,500 (25%) → Paid: 250
>
> *Result:* Same signups, 3x revenue. Now acquisition investment makes sense.

**Why it matters:**

Activation is the multiplier for everything else. If only 8% of signups see value, you're wasting 92% of your acquisition spend. Double activation and you double revenue without touching anything else. Most B2B products have massive activation problems because they were never designed for self-serve discovery.
