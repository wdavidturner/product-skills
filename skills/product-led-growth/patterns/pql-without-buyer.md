## High Usage Without a Buyer

Usage alone doesn't create pipeline. In enterprise, the user is rarely the buyer. You might have amazing product adoption at a Fortune 500 company, but if no decision-maker is engaged, you have no deal.

**Incorrect (assuming usage equals readiness to buy):**

> **Sales Pipeline Report:**
>
> "We have a PQA at Acme Corp! 15 users, heavy feature usage, all signals are green. Sending our best AE."
>
> AE reaches out to the most active user: "Hi, I noticed your team is using [Product] heavily. Ready to discuss an enterprise license?"
>
> User: "I have no idea what you're talking about. I just use this for my personal workflow. I can't buy anything — that's way above my pay grade."
>
> *Result:* AE wastes cycles. User feels ambushed. No deal.

**Correct (connecting usage to buyers):**

> **Sales Pipeline Report:**
>
> "We have a PQA at Acme Corp! 15 users, heavy feature usage. None of them are in procurement or have budget authority."
>
> **Action plan:**
> 1. Marketing runs ABM campaign targeting IT and Procurement at Acme
> 2. Find champion among users who might advocate internally
> 3. Look for signals: anyone viewing Terms of Service? Any admin role changes?
> 4. When buyer is identified AND connected to usage, then AE engages
>
> *Result:* Marketing finds VP of Engineering through LinkedIn campaign. AE reaches out with context: "Your team has been using [Product] for 3 months. Would love to discuss enterprise security features that IT typically wants at this scale."

**Why it matters:**

90% of product-led sales is converting usage into opportunity by finding a buyer outside the user base. PQA without PQL requires marketing intervention. If you just send sales at high-usage accounts without buyers, you're doing cold outreach with extra steps.
