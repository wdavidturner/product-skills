## Skipping User Profiling Questions

Many teams skip signup questions to reduce friction. But without knowing who users are — their company size, role, and use case — you can't personalize their experience or qualify them for sales.

**Incorrect (minimizing all signup friction):**

> **Signup Philosophy:**
>
> "Every question we ask reduces conversion. Let's just ask for email and password. We'll figure out who they are later."
>
> **Result:**
> - Can't personalize onboarding (developer vs. marketer need different flows)
> - Can't identify enterprise prospects vs. students
> - Sales wastes time on unqualified leads
> - Can't segment data for analysis
> - "Later" never comes — users don't fill out profiles voluntarily

**Correct (strategic profiling questions):**

> **Signup Philosophy:**
>
> "We need 4 pieces of information to serve users well. Questions that drop low-intent users are fine — they weren't going to activate anyway."
>
> **Questions (4 screens max):**
> 1. Company size (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, 200+, Personal)
> 2. Your role (Engineering, Product, Marketing, Design, Other)
> 3. What brings you here today? (use case selection)
> 4. Company name + work email (enriched via Clearbit/ZoomInfo)
>
> **What you gain:**
> - Personalized onboarding by use case
> - Automatic enterprise flagging (>200 employees = alert sales)
> - Segmented activation analysis (engineers activate at 30%, marketers at 15% — different problems)
> - ICP fit scoring from day one
>
> **Conversion impact:** ~5% drop-off on profiling screens. But users who drop there had lowest activation rates anyway.

**Why it matters:**

Know your users. Profile them on signup. The users who won't answer 4 questions weren't going to complete a 10-step onboarding anyway. The data you collect enables everything else — personalization, qualification, and analysis. This is non-negotiable for PLG.
