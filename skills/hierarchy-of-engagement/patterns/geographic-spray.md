## Growing Everywhere Means Retaining Nowhere

For products that need local density (social apps, marketplaces, dating apps), growing via non-geographic channels means spreading users so thin that none have a good experience.

**Incorrect (spray and pray growth):**

> **Friend-Making App Growth Strategy:**
>
> "We're growing via TikTok! Our videos are going viral and we're getting thousands of downloads every day from all over the world."
>
> *The math*:
> - 10,000 downloads this week
> - Spread across 3,000 cities
> - Average: 3 users per city
> - A friend-making app with 3 users in a city = useless
>
> *Result*: Everyone churns because there's no one to connect with. High download numbers, zero retention.

**Correct (constrained geographic focus):**

> **Friend-Making App Growth Strategy:**
>
> "We're focusing exclusively on LA for our first 6 months.
>
> - All marketing targets LA residents
> - All paid acquisition is geo-fenced to LA
> - Product features assume LA density (events, meetups)
>
> Goal: 50,000 active users in LA before expanding.
>
> At that density:
> - Every user has hundreds of potential matches nearby
> - We can host in-person events
> - Word of mouth becomes possible
> - The product actually works
>
> Only then do we move to city #2."

**Why it matters:**

Sarah Tavel sees this mistake constantly: founders growing user numbers via channels that scatter users geographically. For any product where the value depends on other users being nearby (dating, social, local marketplaces), this guarantees failure. It's better to have 1,000 users in one city than 10,000 users across 100 cities.
