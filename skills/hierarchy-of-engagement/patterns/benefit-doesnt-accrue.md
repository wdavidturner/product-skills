## The Product Must Get Better With Use

"We have great features" isn't accruing benefit. The product must demonstrably improve for *that specific user* the more they use it. Static products, no matter how good, don't create Level 2 engagement.

**Incorrect (features that don't compound):**

> **Fitness App Strategy:**
>
> "Our app has the best workout library, the cleanest UI, and the most detailed exercise instructions. Users love our features. We keep adding more workouts to the library."
>
> *Problem*: A user who's been with you for 2 years has the same experience as a user on day 1. Both see the same workout library. There's no accumulated value.
>
> *Result*: Users leave for the next shiny app because switching costs nothing.

**Correct (benefits that compound over time):**

> **Fitness App Strategy:**
>
> "The more you work out with us, the better your experience becomes:
> - We learn your fitness level and adjust recommendations
> - We track your progress over months and show your improvement
> - We know which exercises you like and which you skip
> - We've built a history of your PRs, measurements, and milestones
> - Your workout plans adapt to what's working for you specifically
>
> After a year, you have a personalized fitness system that knows you. Starting over with a competitor means losing all that context."

**Why it matters:**

Evernote users with thousands of notes have built an irreplaceable external brain. They can search and find any document. That value took years to build. This is why Evernote users stay even when competitors launch — the switching cost isn't learning a new app, it's losing your entire archive.
