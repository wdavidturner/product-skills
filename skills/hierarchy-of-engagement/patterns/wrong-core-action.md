## Your Core Action Must Predict Retention

The core action isn't just any engagement metric — it's the action most predictive of whether users come back. Choosing wrong means optimizing for something that doesn't matter.

**Incorrect (picking activity that feels important):**

> **Social Photo App - Core Action Definition:**
>
> "Our core action is 'opening the app daily.' We measure DAU and focus our whole product on getting people to open the app every day. We send push notifications, add streaks, do everything to drive opens."
>
> *Result*: High DAU, but cohort retention drops off cliff. Users open but don't engage meaningfully.

**Correct (picking action that predicts retention):**

> **Social Photo App - Core Action Analysis:**
>
> We analyzed every action users can take:
> - Open app: 60% do it, but only 30% who open return next week
> - View feed: 55% do it, 35% return rate
> - Like a photo: 40% do it, 50% return rate
> - Post a photo: 15% do it, 85% return rate
> - Comment on a friend's photo: 20% do it, 82% return rate
>
> **Insight**: Posting and commenting drive retention, not passive viewing.
>
> **Core action**: Creating or commenting on content.
>
> **New focus**: Get new users to post their first photo within 24 hours.

**Why it matters:**

Pinterest discovered that users who pinned something had >90% probability of returning the next week — far higher than those who just browsed. If they'd optimized for "time on site" instead of "pins," they'd have built a very different (and likely much less successful) product.
