## Pure Anonymity Prevents Accruing Benefit and Mounting Loss

When users are completely anonymous, they can't accumulate value that's tied to their identity. No identity means no mounting loss — they can leave and restart without losing anything.

**Incorrect (full anonymity with no identity):**

> **Anonymous Discussion App:**
>
> "We're building a place for authentic conversation. Users are completely anonymous — no usernames, no profiles, no history. Pure freedom!"
>
> *What happens*:
> - Users post, but nothing accrues to them
> - They can't build a reputation or following
> - If they leave and come back, they start completely fresh
> - There's no reason to be loyal — any anonymous app is interchangeable
>
> *Result*: High churn, no defensibility. Users drift to whichever anonymous app is newest.

**Correct (pseudo-anonymity that allows accruing value):**

> **Reddit's Model:**
>
> "Users are anonymous (no real names required) but have persistent identities:
> - Usernames that build recognition in communities
> - Karma that accrues over time
> - Post history that others can see
> - Followers who want to see their content
>
> A power Reddit user has years of karma, a known username, and followers. That's all mounting loss. They're not 'anonymous' in the sense that matters — they've built something they'd lose by leaving."

**Why it matters:**

Sarah Tavel observed that pure anonymity is the challenge: you can't have accruing benefit or mounting loss without some form of persistent identity. Even pseudo-anonymous platforms (Reddit usernames, Twitter handles) create enough identity for users to accumulate value. The key is that *something* persists across sessions that users can build upon.
