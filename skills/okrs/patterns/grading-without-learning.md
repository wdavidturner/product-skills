## The Retrospective Matters More Than the Score

Many teams obsess over getting the "right" grade (was it 0.7 or 0.75?) while skipping the retrospective entirely. This inverts the purpose. The learning is the point; the grade is just a prompt for reflection.

**Incorrect (grade-focused):**

> **Q1 Grading Meeting:**
>
> "Let's see... retention was 48% and we targeted 55%. That's... 87%? No wait, it started at 42%, so the improvement was 6% out of 13%... that's 46%? Or do we count..."
>
> *Two hours of calculation later*
>
> "Okay, final grade: 0.72. Meeting adjourned."
>
> *No discussion of what was learned*

**Correct (learning-focused):**

> **Q1 Grading Meeting:**
>
> "Retention hit 48%, up from 42%. We called it roughly 70% of our goal. Now, the important questions:
>
> - **What worked?** The new onboarding emails drove a 5% lift. Keep those.
> - **What didn't work?** The in-app tutorial had no measurable impact despite months of work. Why?
> - **What surprised us?** Users who talked to support within the first week retained at 2x the rate. We didn't expect that.
> - **What should we try next quarter?** Maybe proactive outreach beats better self-serve?"

**Why it matters:**

OKRs create a learning cycle. Each quarter you get smarter about your market, your product, and your execution. If grading is just scoring, you miss the learning. A quarter where you learned "this approach doesn't work" is valuable—if you capture and apply that insight.
