## Don't Let Measurement Precision Block Progress

Teams often stall on key results because they can't find the "perfect" metric. Good enough is good enough. Start measuring something, learn from it, and refine over time.

**Incorrect (paralysis by measurement):**

> **Team:** "We want to measure customer satisfaction."
>
> **Week 1:** "Should we use NPS? CSAT? CES?"
> **Week 2:** "NPS has problems... there's a lot of backlash against it"
> **Week 3:** "Maybe we should build our own satisfaction index"
> **Week 4:** "How do we weight the factors?"
> **Week 5:** "Let's research what top companies do..."
>
> *Quarter ends with no measurement in place*

**Correct (start and iterate):**

> **Team:** "We want to measure customer satisfaction."
>
> **Day 1:** "Let's use NPS. It's not perfect, but it's good enough to start."
> **Week 4:** "Hmm, NPS scores don't correlate with retention. Let's add a qualitative panel."
> **Week 8:** "The panel is giving us insights NPS missed. Next quarter we might replace NPS entirely."
>
> *Quarter ends with real data and learning about what works*

**Why it matters:**

You don't know which metric is best until you try it. NPS might work for you; it might not. Customer panels might reveal more; they might not. The only way to learn is to pick something, use it, and evaluate whether it predicts what you care about. Waiting for perfect measurement means no measurement.
