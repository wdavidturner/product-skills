## Key Results Are Outcomes, Not Tasks

Key results must describe what will change in the world, not what you'll do. This is the most common OKR mistake and it completely defeats the purpose.

**Incorrect (tasks disguised as key results):**

> **Objective:** Improve customer onboarding experience
>
> **Key Results:**
> 1. Ship new onboarding flow by March 15
> 2. Write 10 help articles for new users
> 3. Conduct 5 user interviews
> 4. Launch email drip campaign

These are all tasks. You can complete every one and still have terrible onboarding. There's no measure of whether anything actually improved.

**Correct (actual outcomes):**

> **Objective:** Create an onboarding experience that makes users successful from day one
>
> **Key Results:**
> 1. Increase Day-7 retention from 35% to 50%
> 2. Reduce time-to-first-value from 3 days to 4 hours
> 3. Improve onboarding NPS from 32 to 55

Now the team can try any approach—new flows, articles, interviews, emails—and measure whether it works. They're empowered to iterate until they find what moves the numbers.

**Why it matters:**

Tasks describe effort. Outcomes describe impact. If you track tasks, you create busy work. If you track outcomes, you create results. A team that ships the new flow but doesn't move retention has learned something valuable—the flow wasn't the problem.
