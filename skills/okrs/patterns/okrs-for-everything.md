## Keep-the-Lights-On Work Doesn't Need OKRs

OKRs are for the big rock you must move, not for all the work your team does. Trying to fit all work into OKRs dilutes focus and creates meaningless goals.

**Incorrect (everything is an OKR):**

> **Engineering Team OKRs:**
> 1. **Objective:** Keep systems running
>    - KR: Maintain 99.9% uptime
>    - KR: Resolve critical bugs within 24 hours
>    - KR: Complete quarterly security patches
>
> 2. **Objective:** Support other teams
>    - KR: Answer internal requests within 48 hours
>    - KR: Attend all planning meetings
>
> 3. **Objective:** Actually build something new (the real OKR buried here)
>    - KR: Launch new search feature

Now "maintain uptime" (business as usual) gets equal billing with "launch new search" (the actual priority). When conflicts arise, it's unclear what to choose.

**Correct (OKRs for the priority, not the baseline):**

> **Engineering Team OKR:**
>
> **Objective:** Make search so good that users stop asking for filters
>
> **Key Results:**
> 1. Search success rate increases from 40% to 75%
> 2. Average searches per session drops from 4 to 1.5
> 3. Support tickets about "can't find X" decrease 60%
>
> **Business as Usual (tracked separately):**
> - Maintain 99.9% uptime
> - Critical bug SLA: 24 hours
> - Security patches: quarterly

**Why it matters:**

Every team has maintenance work that must continue. That's their job description, not their OKR. OKRs identify the ADDITIONAL focus that needs concentrated attention this quarter. If you track everything as OKRs, the truly important work gets lost in the noise.
