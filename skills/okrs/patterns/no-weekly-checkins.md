## Set and Forget Kills OKRs

OKRs that only come up at the start and end of the quarter are just PowerPoint exercises. The weekly cadence—Monday commits and Friday celebrations—is where the actual work happens.

**Incorrect (quarterly-only OKRs):**

> **January:** Big OKR kickoff! Excitement! Posters on walls!
>
> **February:** "Wait, what were our OKRs again?" (No one checks)
>
> **March:** "Oh no, it's grading time. Let me look up what we promised..."
>
> **Result:** OKRs disconnected from daily work. Team reverts to old patterns. Grading is a fiction.

**Correct (weekly rhythm):**

> **Every Monday (15 minutes):**
> - Confidence check on each key result (1-5 scale)
> - Top 3 priorities for the week toward the OKR
> - What we learned last week
> - What's blocking progress
>
> **Every Friday (10 minutes):**
> - What was the most awesome thing that happened this week?
> - Celebrate wins across the team
>
> **Result:** OKRs stay top of mind. Team catches problems early. Adjustments happen weekly, not quarterly.

**Why it matters:**

The weekly check-in creates "retrieval practice"—you keep reconnecting with your goals until they're in long-term memory. After a few weeks, you don't need to look up your OKRs; they're just how you think. This is when OKRs become powerful: when every daily decision automatically weighs against "Will this move our key results?"
