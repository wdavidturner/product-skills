## Objectives Should Make You Want to Get Out of Bed

Objectives are qualitative and should be inspiring. When your alarm goes off Monday morning, you should think "I'm doing something meaningful today." If your objective reads like a project ticket, you've missed the point.

**Incorrect (boring objectives):**

> **Objective:** Complete the Q1 product roadmap items
>
> **Objective:** Improve platform stability metrics
>
> **Objective:** Increase marketing qualified leads

These read like status reports. No one is excited to complete roadmap items. No one tells their spouse "Honey, I'm going to improve our platform stability metrics today!"

**Correct (inspiring objectives):**

> **Objective:** Build a product our users can't imagine living without
>
> **Objective:** Create a platform so reliable that customers forget we exist (in a good way)
>
> **Objective:** Become the company that every marketing team recommends to their friends

Now there's emotional pull. The team understands what success FEELS like, not just what it measures. They can make judgment calls because they understand the spirit of the goal.

**Why it matters:**

Objectives set the emotional tone for the quarter. Boring objectives create compliance—people check boxes. Inspiring objectives create commitment—people go the extra mile. When decisions get hard, an inspiring objective helps people choose correctly without asking permission.
