## Vague Objectives Like "Improve Quality" Mean Nothing

Fluffy objectives sound good but provide no guidance. If your objective could mean anything, it means nothing. Teams need enough specificity to make decisions without asking permission.

**Incorrect (fluffy objectives):**

> **Objective:** Improve product quality
>
> **Objective:** Enhance customer experience
>
> **Objective:** Drive growth

What IS quality? Fewer bugs? Better UX? Faster performance? Each interpretation leads to completely different work. A fluffy objective forces every decision back to leadership for interpretation.

**Correct (specific enough to act on):**

> **Objective:** Make our product so reliable that customers never lose work
>
> **Objective:** Create an onboarding experience so smooth that new users feel like experts within an hour
>
> **Objective:** Build a word-of-mouth engine where happy users recruit their colleagues

Now teams can make autonomous decisions. "Does this feature help users feel like experts?" becomes a clear test.

**Why it matters:**

Fluffy objectives create two failure modes: (1) Teams interpret the objective differently, pulling in conflicting directions. (2) Every decision gets escalated because no one knows what the objective really means. Good objectives are specific enough to guide daily decisions while still being inspiring.
