## OKRs Without Strategy Is Goal Theater

OKRs answer "What are we doing this quarter?" Strategy answers "Why this and not something else?" Without strategy, OKRs are just arbitrary goals disconnected from any coherent path to winning.

**Incorrect (OKRs in a strategy vacuum):**

> **CEO:** "We need OKRs for Q1. What should we focus on?"
>
> **Team brainstorm:**
> - "We should improve the dashboard!"
> - "Let's add more integrations!"
> - "What about a mobile app?"
>
> **Resulting OKR:**
> "Launch 5 new integrations and redesign the dashboard"

There's no answer to "Why these goals?" The team picked things that sounded good without any strategic rationale. When Q2 comes, they'll pick different random things.

**Correct (strategy-driven OKRs):**

> **Strategy:** "We'll win by being the easiest tool for small businesses to adopt—zero friction onboarding, no IT required."
>
> **Q1 OKR:**
>
> **Objective:** Make onboarding so simple that users can go live in under an hour
>
> **Key Results:**
> 1. Reduce time-to-first-value from 4 days to 1 hour
> 2. 60% of new users complete setup without contacting support
> 3. Self-serve onboarding satisfaction score of 4.5/5

Now the OKR clearly connects to the strategy. The dashboard redesign and mobile app might wait because they don't serve the "easiest to adopt" strategy this year.

**Why it matters:**

Strategy creates coherence across quarters. Without it, each quarter's OKRs are disconnected experiments. With it, each quarter builds on the last toward a clear way of winning. OKRs reveal missing strategy—if you can't explain why THIS objective, you need strategy work.
