## Goals Should Make You Uncomfortable, Not Safe

If you always hit 100% of your OKRs, you're not stretching. Sandbagging—setting easy goals you're certain to hit—turns OKRs into paperwork instead of a tool for growth.

**Incorrect (sandbagged goals):**

> **Last quarter:** Retention was 42%
>
> **This quarter's key result:** "Achieve 43% retention"
>
> **Team thinking:** "We can definitely hit this. Maybe we'll even look good by hitting 45%!"

The team is optimizing for looking good, not for pushing boundaries. They'll hit the goal and learn nothing about what's actually possible.

**Correct (ambitious but achievable):**

> **Last quarter:** Retention was 42%
>
> **This quarter's key result:** "Achieve 55% retention"
>
> **Team thinking:** "Wow, that's a stretch. We'll need to try something fundamentally different, not just incremental improvements."

At 70% achievement (around 51% retention), the team would have learned enormously about what works. They might not hit 55%, but they'll have pushed harder than if they aimed for 43%.

**Why it matters:**

The research is clear: ambitious goals are more motivating than easy ones—unless people feel doomed to fail. The sweet spot is goals that feel uncomfortable but possible. If you hit 100% of your OKRs, raise your ambition. If you hit 30%, you may have aimed too high or need to address execution problems.
