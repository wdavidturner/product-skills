## One Objective Per Quarter, Not Five

The point of OKRs is radical focus. If you have five objectives, you have zero focus. The famous "peanut butter memo" at Yahoo described spreading resources so thin that nothing meaningful happens.

**Incorrect (the peanut butter approach):**

> **Q1 OKRs:**
> 1. Improve customer retention
> 2. Launch mobile app
> 3. Expand to European market
> 4. Reduce customer support costs
> 5. Improve developer velocity
>
> Each objective has 4 key results = 20 metrics to track.

Everyone is working at 20% capacity on everything. Nothing gets the focus needed to actually move. At the end of the quarter, everything is 30% done.

**Correct (radical focus):**

> **Q1 OKR:**
>
> **Objective:** Become the retention leader in our category
>
> **Key Results:**
> 1. Increase 90-day retention from 40% to 55%
> 2. Reduce churn rate from 5% to 3% monthly
> 3. Achieve NPS of 50+ among 6-month customers

The mobile app, European expansion, and other initiatives can wait. Or they're "business as usual" that continues without OKR focus. This quarter is about retention. Everyone knows it. Every decision weighs against it.

**Why it matters:**

If everything is a priority, nothing is. OKRs only work when they represent the ONE thing that must move this quarter. Your company is already doing a thousand things—OKRs identify the single most important one that needs concentrated attention.
