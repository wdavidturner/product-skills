## Quarterly Is the Sweet Spot for Most Teams

Some companies set annual OKRs, then wonder why they feel disconnected from daily work. Quarterly is long enough to accomplish meaningful progress, short enough to remember what you committed to.

**Incorrect (annual OKRs):**

> **January:** Set ambitious annual OKRs
>
> **March:** "Wait, the market changed. Our OKR doesn't make sense anymore."
>
> **June:** "We're so far from the January OKR, why bother checking?"
>
> **December:** "Let's just set new OKRs and pretend this year didn't happen."

Annual OKRs suffer from several problems:
- Too much changes in a year
- Hard to remember what you committed to
- No natural checkpoint for learning and adjustment

**Correct (quarterly with annual strategy):**

> **Annual Strategy:** "This year we focus on becoming the retention leader"
>
> **Q1 OKR:** Build the retention measurement infrastructure
> **Q2 OKR:** Identify and fix top 3 churn drivers
> **Q3 OKR:** Create a proactive retention program
> **Q4 OKR:** Make retention a competitive advantage
>
> Each quarter builds on the last. Each quarter has its own grade and retrospective.

**Why it matters:**

Spotify described quarterly as "long enough to get something done and short enough to not forget what you did." Annual OKRs lose the learning cycle that makes OKRs powerful. Set annual strategy, but use quarterly OKRs to make progress visible and create regular learning checkpoints.
