## Friday Celebrations Build Momentum

Many teams skip celebrations as "soft" or "unproductive." This is a mistake. Regular celebrations build morale, reinforce focus on the OKR, and help people feel part of something meaningful.

**Incorrect (all work, no celebration):**

> **Friday 5pm:**
>
> "Okay, we're behind on the key result. Everyone needs to push harder next week. Meeting adjourned."
>
> *Team leaves feeling burned out and disconnected*
>
> Repeat for 12 weeks.

**Correct (intentional celebration):**

> **Friday 4:30pm (15 minutes):**
>
> "Before we wrap up, what was the most awesome thing that happened this week?"
>
> - "Marketing got 50 signups from that blog post!"
> - "Engineering finally fixed the performance bug we've been chasing for months"
> - "Customer success got a referral from a customer who said we changed their business"
>
> *Team leaves feeling connected and energized*

**Why it matters:**

Some CEOs have started Friday celebrations BEFORE implementing OKRs and reported immediate culture improvement. The simple act of asking "What was awesome this week?" helps people feel they're part of something special. It also reinforces what good looks like—the wins you celebrate become the behaviors teams repeat.
