## Approval Cycles That Eat Weeks Defeat the Purpose

If it takes three weeks to get OKRs approved, you've lost a quarter of the quarter. The approval process often becomes a bottleneck that destroys OKR effectiveness.

**Incorrect (bureaucratic approval):**

> **Week 1:** Teams draft OKRs
> **Week 2:** Managers review and request changes
> **Week 3:** Directors review and request more changes
> **Week 4:** VP aligns with other VPs, finds conflicts
> **Week 5:** CEO reviews, asks "Why this?"
> **Week 6:** Teams revise based on exec feedback
> **Week 7:** Final approval
>
> Result: 7 weeks of a 13-week quarter spent on approvals. Teams demoralized before they start.

**Correct (peer review):**

> **Day 1:** Team drafts OKRs
> **Day 2-3:** Get 3 peer teams to review (24-hour turnaround each)
> - "Does this look right?"
> - "See any conflicts with your work?"
> - "Anything we're missing?"
> **Day 4:** Incorporate feedback, finalize
> **Day 5:** Share with leadership for awareness (not approval)
>
> Result: 5 days. Teams start executing in week 2.

**Why it matters:**

The teams doing the work have the best context. Peer review catches conflicts and blind spots without creating bottlenecks. If leadership doesn't trust teams to set reasonable OKRs, that's a hiring or empowerment problem to solve—not a reason to create approval bureaucracy.
