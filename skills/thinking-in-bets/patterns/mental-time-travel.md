## Ask "How Will I Feel About This in 10 Years?"

In the moment, problems feel enormous. Mental time travel—projecting yourself into the future—breaks the grip of present emotions and creates perspective. Most things that feel catastrophic now will be funny stories later.

**Incorrect (trapped in the present moment):**

> **After a failed product launch:**
>
> PM (to their manager): "This is a disaster. I've ruined my reputation. The exec team will never trust me again. I should probably start looking for another job."
>
> Manager: "It's definitely a setback..."
>
> PM: "My career at this company is over."

The PM is catastrophizing. The present-moment emotions are dominating their judgment.

**Correct (using mental time travel):**

> **After a failed product launch:**
>
> PM (to their manager): "This is rough. I feel like I've failed badly."
>
> Manager: "Let's try something. It's 10 years from now. You're at a dinner party telling this story. How does it go?"
>
> PM: "I guess... 'Yeah, that launch was a mess. We learned a ton about customer research from it. Actually, the next launch worked because of what we learned failing.'"
>
> Manager: "Will you still be devastated in 10 years?"
>
> PM: "No. It'll be one story among many."
>
> Manager: "Right. So what can we learn now that makes this worth the tuition?"

The time travel reframe broke the emotional grip and shifted focus to learning.

**How to use mental time travel:**

- **For setbacks:** "How will I feel about this in 1 year? 5 years? 10 years?"
- **For decisions:** "If I choose A vs. B, which will I regret more in 10 years?"
- **For conflicts:** "Will this disagreement matter in a year? Will I even remember it?"
- **For risk-taking:** "What's worse: failing and recovering, or never trying?"

**Daniel Kahneman's insight:** "Nothing is as important as it seems when you're thinking about it."

The focusing effect makes current problems feel overwhelming. Time travel counteracts this by revealing the broader context of your life.

**Why it matters:**

Emotions are data, but they're not always accurate data. Present-moment feelings often lead to decisions you'll regret—overreacting, catastrophizing, or playing it too safe. Mental time travel restores proportion.
