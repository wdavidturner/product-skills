## Stop Seeking Alignment — It Doesn't Exist

"Are we all aligned?" is a coercive question that creates false consensus. Ten people in a room have ten different opinions. They're never going to fully agree. Pretending they do leads to resentment, shallow buy-in, and worse decisions.

**Incorrect (seeking alignment):**

> **Strategy meeting:**
>
> VP: "So we're going to prioritize international expansion over enterprise features. Everyone aligned?"
>
> [Uncomfortable silence. Two people nod. One stares at laptop.]
>
> VP: "Great, we're aligned. Let's move forward."
>
> [Six weeks later: PM is passive-aggressively slow-rolling international work. VP is confused and frustrated.]

The PM wasn't aligned—they were silenced. The VP's question didn't create agreement, it suppressed disagreement.

**Correct (acknowledging disagreement, deciding anyway):**

> **Strategy meeting (after independent input collection):**
>
> VP: "Here's the spread: 3 of you prefer international expansion, 2 prefer enterprise features. I've heard both arguments. They're both reasonable."
>
> PM (enterprise advocate): "I still think enterprise is the safer bet."
>
> VP: "I understand, and your reasoning about churn risk is valid. Nevertheless, we're going with international expansion. Here's why: [reasoning]. I know this isn't the direction you advocated for. I'm not asking you to agree—I'm asking you to commit to executing well."
>
> PM: "Understood. I disagree with the strategy but I'll execute."
>
> VP: "That's all I'm asking. Thank you."

The PM feels heard but knows the decision is made. There's no false consensus, just clear accountability.

**The word "nevertheless":**

After reflecting back someone's position:
- "I hear you. Nevertheless, here's what we're doing."
- "Your concerns are valid. Nevertheless, we're moving forward."
- "I understand you disagree. Nevertheless, this is the decision."

It acknowledges their input without pretending you've reached agreement.

**Why it matters:**

Alignment is a fantasy. Seeking it creates two bad outcomes: (1) People who disagree stay silent and undermine execution, or (2) the group compromises to a mediocre middle ground. Neither is good. Clear decisions with acknowledged disagreement are better than false consensus.
