## Use the Exact Question Wording

The 40% benchmark only works with Sean Ellis's exact question wording. Variations sound similar but measure different things and invalidate the benchmark.

**Incorrect (modified wording):**

> **Survey question:** "Would you be disappointed if this product no longer existed?"
>
> **Result:** 52% said "Yes"
>
> **Team's conclusion:** "We have strong PMF! Let's scale."

The problem: "disappointed if it no longer existed" is passive and hypothetical. It measures sentiment, not dependence. A user might be disappointed a product disappeared (it was nice!) without actually needing it.

**Correct (exact wording):**

> **Survey question:** "How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?"
> - Very disappointed
> - Somewhat disappointed
> - Not disappointed
>
> **Result:** 31% said "Very disappointed"
>
> **Team's conclusion:** "We're below 40%. We need to improve PMF before scaling."

The exact wording emphasizes personal inability to use ("you could no longer use"), not abstract existence. This measures dependence: would YOU personally miss it?

**Why it matters:**

Sean Ellis benchmarked thousands of companies using the exact wording. His 40% threshold only applies to that specific question. Change the wording, and you're measuring something different without a valid benchmark to compare against.
