## The Three Questions That Unlock the Roadmap Algorithm

The core disappointment question tells you your score. But without follow-up questions, you can't run the algorithm that improves it.

**Incorrect (just the core question):**

> **Survey:**
> 1. How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?
>
> **Results:** 28% very disappointed
>
> **Team's situation:** "We know our score is low but we have no idea why or what to do about it."

You have a number but no insights to act on.

**Correct (full question set):**

> **Survey:**
> 1. How would you feel if you could no longer use [product]?
>    - Very disappointed / Somewhat disappointed / Not disappointed
>
> 2. What type of people do you think would most benefit from [product]?
>    - [Free text]
>
> 3. What is the main benefit you receive from [product]?
>    - [Free text]
>
> 4. How can we improve [product] for you?
>    - [Free text]
>
> **Results:** 28% very disappointed
>
> **Team's analysis:**
> - Q2 tells us who our ideal customer is (from the perspective of people who love us)
> - Q3 tells us our core value proposition (what we must protect)
> - Q4 from segmented groups tells us the roadmap (what to build)

Each question serves a specific purpose in the algorithm. Without Q3, you can't filter the "Somewhat Disappointed" segment. Without Q4, you don't know what to build.

**Why it matters:**

The PMF score alone is a lagging indicator. The follow-up questions give you leading indicators and actionable insights. Skip them and you've measured your position without a map for how to improve it.
