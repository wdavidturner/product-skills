## Half Your Time on Strengths, Half on Objections

Teams either over-index on fixing problems (reactive) or on building new things (proactive). The PMF Engine prescribes a specific balance: 50% doubling down on what lovers love, 50% fixing objections from convertible users.

**Incorrect (all defensive):**

> **Roadmap approach:** "Let's fix all the things people complain about."
>
> **Result:** You stop the bleeding but never get better. PMF score plateaus. You're maintaining, not growing. What made you special erodes as you chase parity.

**Incorrect (all offensive):**

> **Roadmap approach:** "Let's build more amazing features that differentiate us."
>
> **Result:** You keep adding capabilities but the objections remain. Users try your amazing new features but still churn because the basics aren't solid. PMF score stays flat.

**Correct (balanced approach):**

> **Roadmap allocation:**
>
> **50% - Double down on loved features:**
> - "Very Disappointed" users love speed? Make it even faster.
> - They love keyboard shortcuts? Add more power-user shortcuts.
> - They love the design? Polish it further.
>
> **50% - Fix objections from convertible fence-sitters:**
> - "Somewhat Disappointed" (Group A) want better mobile? Build it.
> - They want reliability improvements? Invest in infrastructure.
>
> **Result:** Lovers become evangelists (they get even more of what they love). Fence-sitters convert (their objections disappear). PMF score rises on both vectors.

**Why it matters:**

This balance is what Rahul Vohra calls the algorithm writing your roadmap. It's not intuitive - most teams skew one direction. But the math works: increasing what lovers love AND decreasing what holds fence-sitters back creates compound growth in your PMF score.
