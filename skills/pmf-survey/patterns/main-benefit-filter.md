## Only Act on Feedback From Users Who Love Your Core Value

Not all "Somewhat Disappointed" users are equal. Some love your core value but have minor objections (convertible). Others like you for different reasons entirely (not convertible without changing your product).

**Incorrect (treating all fence-sitters the same):**

> **"Somewhat Disappointed" improvement requests:**
> 1. Better mobile app - 25 mentions
> 2. Calendar integration - 22 mentions
> 3. More templates - 18 mentions
>
> **Team's response:** "Let's build all three in order of popularity."

But wait - "calendar integration" came mostly from users who said the main benefit was "keeping track of meetings," not your actual core value of "blazing fast email."

**Correct (filtering by main benefit):**

> **Step 1: What do "Very Disappointed" users say is the main benefit?**
> - "Speed" - 45%
> - "Keyboard shortcuts" - 30%
> - "Clean design" - 25%
>
> **Step 2: Split "Somewhat Disappointed" by whether they share this main benefit**
>
> **Group A (main benefit = speed/shortcuts/design):**
> - Better mobile app - 20 mentions
> - More templates - 15 mentions
>
> **Group B (main benefit = something else, like calendar):**
> - Calendar integration - 22 mentions
> - Better search - 10 mentions
>
> **Team's response:** "Build mobile app and templates (Group A feedback). Ignore calendar and search (Group B feedback) - these users like us for the wrong reasons."

**Why it matters:**

Group B users will never become "Very Disappointed" even if you build everything they ask for - because they don't value your core. Building for them actively harms your PMF by diluting focus. The main benefit filter is what makes the algorithm work.
