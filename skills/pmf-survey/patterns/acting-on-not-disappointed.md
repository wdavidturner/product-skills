## Stop Trying to Convert the "Not Disappointed" Users

It's tempting to win over skeptics. But "Not Disappointed" users are so far from loving your product that converting them would require fundamentally changing what you offer.

**Incorrect (trying to please everyone):**

> **"Not Disappointed" feedback:**
> - "I wish it had more integrations with tools I already use"
> - "The learning curve is too steep"
> - "It's overkill for my simple needs"
> - "Too expensive for what I get"
>
> **Team's response:** "Let's add integrations, simplify the UX, create a lite version, and lower the price. We can win them over!"
>
> *Six months later:* Diluted product that nobody loves. "Very Disappointed" users churning because you broke what made them love you.

**Correct (politely ignoring):**

> **"Not Disappointed" feedback:** [Same as above]
>
> **Team's response:** "These users want a fundamentally different product. If we built what they want, we'd lose what our lovers love. Let's acknowledge we're not for everyone and focus on users who value our core proposition."
>
> **Action:** Improve messaging to attract the right users. Let wrong-fit users self-select out.

Superhuman explicitly positioned as premium email for high-performers. That positioning repelled users who wanted "simple and cheap" - and that was intentional.

**Why it matters:**

You cannot build a product that everyone loves. Attempting to converts "Not Disappointed" users by adding what they want almost always comes at the cost of what "Very Disappointed" users love. The math doesn't work. Focus wins.
