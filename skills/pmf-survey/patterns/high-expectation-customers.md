## Identify Your High-Expectation Customers From Survey Data

Your ideal customer profile should come from users who love you, not from assumptions. The "Very Disappointed" users will tell you who your product is really for.

**Incorrect (assuming your ideal customer):**

> **Team's assumption:** "Our project management tool is perfect for enterprise teams of 50+ people."
>
> **Marketing:** Targets enterprise, builds enterprise features
>
> **Sales:** Focuses on large deals
>
> **Reality:** Most "Very Disappointed" users are actually 5-10 person agencies, not enterprises. Enterprise users are mostly "Somewhat Disappointed."

You're marketing to and building for the wrong people.

**Correct (learning from survey data):**

> **Survey Question 2:** "What type of people do you think would most benefit from [product]?"
>
> **Answers from "Very Disappointed" users:**
> - "Small creative teams who juggle lots of clients"
> - "Agencies with remote contractors"
> - "Freelancers managing multiple projects"
> - "Small teams that need to look professional to clients"
>
> **Insight:** Our High-Expectation Customer (HXC) is small agencies and creative teams, not enterprises. They value looking professional and managing complexity with a small team.
>
> **Action:** Reposition for this segment. Build features that serve this use case. Enterprise is a future expansion, not current PMF.

The people who love you most understand who else would love you. Their descriptions reveal your true positioning.

**Why it matters:**

Chasing the wrong customer segment wastes marketing dollars and distorts your product roadmap. The PMF survey tells you who your product is actually for. Listen to it, even if it contradicts your assumptions.
