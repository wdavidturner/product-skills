## The "Somewhat Disappointed" Segment Is Your Growth Engine

Most teams focus on "Very Disappointed" (lovers) and ignore "Somewhat Disappointed" (fence-sitters). But fence-sitters are your biggest lever for improving PMF score.

**Incorrect (ignoring the middle):**

> **Analysis approach:**
> - "Very Disappointed" users love us - great! Let's keep them happy.
> - "Not Disappointed" users don't care - let's try to win them over with new features.
> - "Somewhat Disappointed"? They're in the middle, nothing actionable there.
>
> **Result:** PMF score stays flat despite shipping features.

You're trying to convert the hardest group (not disappointed) while ignoring the easiest (somewhat disappointed).

**Correct (focusing on convertible users):**

> **Analysis approach:**
> - "Very Disappointed" users (35%) love us for speed and keyboard shortcuts. Double down on these.
> - "Somewhat Disappointed" users (40%) split into two groups:
>   - Group A (25%): Love speed but frustrated by mobile app gaps
>   - Group B (15%): Using us for calendar features, not email
> - "Not Disappointed" users (25%) - politely ignore
>
> **Roadmap:** Fix mobile gaps for Group A. If we convert half of them to "Very Disappointed," our PMF score jumps from 35% to 47%.

The math: Converting somewhat disappointed users who already love your core value is 10x easier than converting users who don't care.

**Why it matters:**

"Somewhat Disappointed" users have already validated that your core value resonates. Something small is holding them back. Find it, fix it, and they become your best advocates. This is the Superhuman PMF Engine's key insight.
