# PMF Survey Template (Copy/Paste)

## Audience (recommended)

Send only to **Eligible Users** (people who reached your Aha moment) and are **recently active** (e.g., last 14–30 days).

## Questions (use the exact wording for Q1)

**Q1. How would you feel if you could no longer use [PRODUCT]?**
- Very disappointed
- Somewhat disappointed
- Not disappointed

**Q2. What type of people do you think would most benefit from [PRODUCT]?**

**Q3. What is the main benefit you receive from [PRODUCT]?**

**Q4. How can we improve [PRODUCT] for you?**

Optional (useful for analysis, keep short):
- Role/title
- Company size
- Primary use case (picklist)
- How they found you (channel)
- What would you use as an alternative?

## Send timing (common trigger)

Trigger after the user experiences value (Aha), not at signup:
- Example: `24–72 hours` after Aha, or after `7 days` of active use post-Aha

## Analysis quick-start

1) Compute **PMF Score** = `% Very disappointed` (overall + by segment)
2) From “Very disappointed”, code Q2/Q3 into themes → your **ICP** + **core value**
3) From “Somewhat disappointed”, only act on Q4 if their Q3 benefit matches the lovers’ core value
