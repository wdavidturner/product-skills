## Monday Interviews Surface Constraints You'd Discover Friday

Expert interviews on Monday bring critical context into the sprint. Skipping them means discovering fatal constraints during Friday testing — when it's too late.

**Incorrect (skip expert interviews):**

> **Monday:** "We already know our product. Let's skip the interviews and get to mapping."
>
> **Tuesday-Thursday:** Team designs an elegant onboarding flow that guides users through setup.
>
> **Friday Interview 1:**
> Customer: "This is nice, but I can't enter my company info here."
> Interviewer: "Why not?"
> Customer: "Legal requires IT to provision accounts. I don't have authority to set this up myself."
>
> **Friday Interview 2, 3, 4, 5:** Same issue. The self-serve onboarding assumption is broken for the entire target segment.
>
> *Result:* Week wasted. A 10-minute conversation with a sales rep on Monday would have revealed this constraint.

**Correct (conduct expert interviews):**

> **Monday Morning:** 15-20 minute interviews with internal experts:
> - Sales rep: "Enterprise customers can't self-serve. IT has to be involved."
> - Customer success: "The biggest drop-off is week 2, not day 1."
> - Engineer: "We're limited by [technical constraint] for the next quarter."
> - Recent customer: "I almost didn't buy because I couldn't figure out [specific concern]."
>
> **How Might We notes:** Team captures insights as opportunities ("How might we... get IT buy-in during onboarding?")
>
> **Afternoon:** Map and target selection incorporates all this context.
>
> **Tuesday-Thursday:** Team designs an onboarding flow that accounts for IT involvement.
>
> **Friday:** Customers respond to the actual reality of their situation. Clear signal on the approach.
>
> *Result:* Prototype matches customer reality. Friday feedback is useful.

**Why it matters:**

Every team has individuals who know crucial details that aren't shared broadly. Expert interviews extract this knowledge in 2-3 hours on Monday so it shapes the entire sprint — instead of torpedoing Friday testing.

**Who to interview:**
- Customer-facing roles (sales, support, success)
- Domain experts (legal, compliance, technical leads)
- Recent customers or users
- Anyone who's tried to solve this problem before
