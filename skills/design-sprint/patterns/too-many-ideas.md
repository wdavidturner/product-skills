## Commit to One Prototype — Not a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure

When the team can't choose between competing approaches, the temptation is to test them all. This produces a confusing prototype and muddy signal.

**Incorrect (hedging with multiple paths):**

> **Wednesday:** Two strong sketches emerge. Team can't decide.
>
> **Compromise:** "Let's test both! We'll show customers Option A and Option B and see which they prefer."
>
> **Thursday Prototype:** Branching paths, "Which would you prefer?" screens, two parallel flows.
>
> **Friday Interview:**
> Customer: "Can you explain the difference between these again?"
> Customer: "I guess... this one? But I'm not sure what I'm choosing."
> Customer: "They both seem fine."
>
> **Team Debrief:** "Well, 3 people chose A and 2 chose B, so A wins?"
>
> *Result:* No clear learning. Customers were confused by the comparison. Feedback was about the comparison, not the concepts.

**Correct (commit to one direction):**

> **Wednesday:** Two strong sketches emerge.
>
> **Decider makes the call:** "I'm going with Approach A. It's riskier, but if it works, the upside is bigger. That's what we need to learn."
>
> **Thursday Prototype:** One coherent flow. All effort goes into making Approach A feel real.
>
> **Friday Interview:**
> Customer: "Oh, I love this. I'd use this instead of [current solution]."
> Customer: "This is confusing — I don't understand why I'd do this step."
> Customer: "This would save me so much time."
>
> **Team Debrief:** "3 of 5 customers loved the core concept. 2 were confused by the setup step. Clear signal: the concept works, but we need to fix onboarding."
>
> *Result:* Clear learning about one approach. Know exactly what to do next.

**Why it matters:**

You can always run another sprint. You can't un-confuse Friday's customers. A sprint that deeply tests one approach gives you:
- Real signal on whether it works
- Specific feedback on what to improve
- Confidence to commit or pivot

Testing two approaches at 50% depth gives you neither.

**If you truly have two divergent approaches:**
Run two separate sprints. Or test Approach A this Friday, iterate Monday-Thursday, test the improved version next Friday.
