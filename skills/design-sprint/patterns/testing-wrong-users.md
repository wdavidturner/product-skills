## Five Target Customers Beats Fifty Random People

The entire sprint builds toward Friday's tests. If you test with the wrong people, you get misleading signal that sends you in the wrong direction.

**Incorrect (convenience recruiting):**

> **Sprint Challenge:** Enterprise HR software for companies with 500+ employees
>
> **Friday Recruiting:** "We couldn't find HR directors on short notice, so we recruited:
> - 2 friends who work in HR (at small startups)
> - 1 recruiter (not HR)
> - 1 office manager (handles some HR tasks)
> - 1 person who 'knows someone in HR'"
>
> **Friday Results:**
> "The dashboard is overwhelming." "I don't understand these compliance features." "Why would I need this integration?"
>
> **Team Conclusion:** "We need to simplify everything."
>
> *Reality:* Real HR directors at large companies would have found the dashboard appropriately detailed. The compliance features are legally required. The integration is essential. You optimized for the wrong users.

**Correct (target customer recruiting):**

> **Sprint Challenge:** Enterprise HR software for companies with 500+ employees
>
> **Friday Recruiting:** (Started 2 weeks before the sprint)
> - Screener: "Do you work in HR? What size is your company? Do you handle compliance reporting?"
> - 5 HR directors or managers at companies with 500-2000 employees
> - Mix of industries, but all match the target profile
> - Backup candidates scheduled in case of no-shows
>
> **Friday Results:**
> "Finally, a compliance dashboard that shows everything in one place." "I wish this integrated with [specific system]." "This would save me 10 hours a month."
>
> **Team Conclusion:** "Core concept works. Need to add [specific system] integration and clarify the onboarding flow."
>
> *Reality:* Real signal from real customers. Clear direction for what to build.

**Why it matters:**

Five interviews is enough to see patterns — but only if the customers are your actual target. The magic of Friday is watching the same reactions repeat across customers. If you recruit randomly, you'll see random patterns.

**Recruiting timeline:**
- 2 weeks before: Write screener, start recruiting
- 1 week before: Confirm 5 participants + 1-2 backups
- Thursday: Send reminders, confirm logistics
- Friday: Run interviews with confidence
