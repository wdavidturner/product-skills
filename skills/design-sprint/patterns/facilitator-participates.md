## Facilitators Facilitate — They Don't Pitch Ideas

The Facilitator's job is to run the process, not to contribute ideas. When facilitators participate, they bias the outcome and undermine trust in the process.

**Incorrect (facilitator participates):**

> **Tuesday:** Facilitator creates a solution sketch alongside the team.
>
> **Wednesday Art Museum:** Facilitator's sketch is on the wall with the others.
>
> **Speed Critique:** Facilitator's sketch gets extra attention. They know how to present ideas compellingly.
>
> **Dot Voting:** Team members notice the facilitator has strong opinions about certain sketches.
>
> **Decider's Concern:** "Did the process favor the facilitator's idea, or was it actually best?"
>
> **Team's Concern:** "Is this really the team's decision, or is the facilitator steering us?"
>
> *Result:* Process is compromised. Even if the right idea wins, trust in the method is damaged.

**Correct (facilitator stays neutral):**

> **Tuesday:** Facilitator runs the sketching exercises, keeps time, answers questions. Does not sketch.
>
> **Wednesday Art Museum:** All sketches are from team members.
>
> **Speed Critique:** Facilitator narrates. Reads the sketches aloud. Captures standout ideas on stickies. Has no personal stake.
>
> **Dot Voting:** Facilitator doesn't vote. Watches where dots cluster without influencing.
>
> **Decider's Decision:** Made with full confidence that the process was fair.
>
> **Team's Trust:** "The facilitator ran a clean process. This is our collective decision."
>
> *Result:* Team owns the outcome. Facilitator is a trusted guide, not a competitor.

**Why it matters:**

The facilitator has asymmetric power — they control time, attention, and process flow. If they also compete for idea selection, team members will wonder (consciously or not) if the game is rigged.

**Facilitator's real contributions:**
- Keep energy high
- Enforce time boxes
- Synthesize patterns across sketches
- Ask clarifying questions
- Guide the Decider through trade-offs

These are more valuable than adding one more sketch to the pile.
