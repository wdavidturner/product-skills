## Friday's Patterns Need Synthesis Before Monday's Decisions

The raw notes from five Friday interviews are overwhelming. Without synthesis, the team leaves with different interpretations and no shared understanding.

**Incorrect (no debrief):**

> **Friday 5pm:** Last interview ends. Team is exhausted.
>
> "Great work everyone! Let's pick this up Monday."
>
> **Weekend:** Each team member remembers different highlights. CEO remembers the positive reactions. Designer remembers the usability issues. Engineer wonders if the whole thing is worth building.
>
> **Monday:** "So, what did we learn?"
>
> CEO: "Customers loved it!"
> Designer: "They were really confused by the navigation."
> Engineer: "I'm not sure we validated the core value prop."
>
> **Debate ensues.** No one has the same picture. Notes are scattered across laptops.
>
> *Result:* Sprint findings are open to interpretation. No clear direction.

**Correct (structured debrief):**

> **Friday 5pm:** Last interview ends.
>
> **Facilitator:** "Before we leave, let's spend 45 minutes synthesizing. Grab your notes."
>
> **Step 1: Individual review (10 min)**
> Each person reviews their notes. Highlights the most important observations.
>
> **Step 2: Pattern sharing (20 min)**
> Go around the room. Each person shares their top 3 patterns.
> Facilitator captures on whiteboard:
> - "4/5 customers confused by pricing page"
> - "3/5 loved the dashboard, 2 didn't understand why they needed it"
> - "All 5 said they'd want to involve their manager in the decision"
>
> **Step 3: Sprint Questions answered (10 min)**
> Return to Monday's Sprint Questions. What did we learn?
>
> **Step 4: Next steps (5 min)**
> Decider: "Based on this, here's what we're doing Monday..."
>
> **Monday:** Team arrives with shared understanding. Notes are consolidated. Direction is clear.
>
> *Result:* Aligned team. Clear next steps. Sprint learning is preserved.

**Why it matters:**

Five interviews generate hundreds of observations. Without synthesis, the team's memory becomes unreliable over the weekend. The debrief captures the shared truth while it's fresh.

**Debrief minimum:**
- 30-60 minutes immediately after the last interview
- Patterns captured on whiteboard/doc everyone can see
- Sprint Questions explicitly answered
- Decider states the next step
