## Test to Learn, Not to Prove You Were Right

If you enter Friday hoping customers will validate your idea, you'll miss the real signal. The unexpected reactions are the valuable ones.

**Incorrect (seeking validation):**

> **Friday Interview 1:**
> Customer: "I'm not sure I understand why I'd use this instead of [current solution]."
>
> **Interviewer thinking:** "They just don't get it. I'll explain better."
>
> **Interviewer response:** "Well, the benefit is that you can [explains the value prop]. Does that make sense?"
>
> **Customer:** "Oh, sure, I guess that makes sense."
>
> **Team in watch room:** "See? Once they understood it, they liked it!"
>
> **After 5 interviews:** "4 out of 5 said they'd use it after we explained it. Great success!"
>
> *Reality:* In the real world, there's no interviewer to explain. The product has to explain itself.

**Correct (genuine curiosity):**

> **Friday Interview 1:**
> Customer: "I'm not sure I understand why I'd use this instead of [current solution]."
>
> **Interviewer thinking:** "Interesting. Let's understand where we lost them."
>
> **Interviewer response:** "Tell me more about that. What's [current solution] doing for you?"
>
> **Customer:** "Well, I've been using it for years and it does [unexpected workflow]. I don't see how this would fit."
>
> **Team in watch room:** "Wait, we didn't know customers were using [current solution] that way."
>
> **After 5 interviews:** "3 customers had the same confusion about how this fits their existing workflow. We're missing a key context: they're not replacing [current solution], they're supplementing it. Our positioning is wrong."
>
> *Reality:* Clear learning about how to reframe the product. Next sprint can test the new positioning.

**Why it matters:**

A sprint that confirms your hypothesis teaches you nothing new. A sprint that reveals unexpected reactions teaches you:
- What you misunderstood about customers
- What context you were missing
- What the real job-to-be-done might be

**Friday mindset:**
- "I wonder what they'll do when they see this"
- "What will surprise us?"
- "What don't we know yet?"

**Not:**
- "I hope they like it"
- "Let me explain why this is good"
- "They just need to understand the vision"
