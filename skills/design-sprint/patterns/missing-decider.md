## Without a Decider, the Sprint Gets Overturned

The Decider is the person who will make the real decision after the sprint — usually the CEO, founder, or product lead. If they're not in the room for all five days, their uninformed opinions will kill your prototype on Monday.

**Incorrect (absent Decider):**

> **Sprint Setup:** CEO says "I trust the team. I'll check in on Friday to see the results."
>
> **Monday-Thursday:** Team aligns on a bold new direction. Prototype tests well.
>
> **Friday Afternoon:** CEO watches the recordings.
>
> **The Following Monday:**
> "I like what you did, but I've been thinking... what about [completely different direction]? Also, I'm not sure about [core assumption you validated]. Let's take some time to think about this."
>
> *Result:* Sprint outcomes are shelved. Team is demoralized. The "real" decision process starts over.

**Correct (Decider present):**

> **Sprint Setup:** CEO clears calendar for the full week. "This is my top priority."
>
> **Monday:** CEO shares context the team didn't have. Votes on the target with full information.
>
> **Wednesday:** CEO casts deciding votes on which direction to prototype. Owns the decision.
>
> **Friday:** CEO watches customers react. Sees the same patterns the team sees.
>
> **The Following Monday:**
> "We all saw what happened. Here's what we're doing next."
>
> *Result:* Clear direction with shared context. No relitigating decisions.

**Why it matters:**

The Decider isn't just there to vote — they're there to build the shared context that makes their post-sprint decisions stick. When they miss the sprint, they lack:
- The Monday context from expert interviews
- The Tuesday solutions they didn't see
- The Wednesday trade-offs they didn't weigh
- The Friday reactions they didn't witness

Without this context, they'll second-guess everything.

**If the Decider can't commit:**
- Reschedule the sprint
- Pick a smaller challenge they can commit to
- Find out who really has decision authority
