## The Storyboard Is the Blueprint — Vague Boards Create Confused Prototypes

The storyboard drawn on Wednesday afternoon is the blueprint for Thursday's prototype. A vague storyboard creates Thursday chaos and Friday confusion.

**Incorrect (vague storyboard):**

> **Wednesday Afternoon Storyboard:**
> ```
> Frame 1: "User sees homepage"
> Frame 2: "User clicks signup"
> Frame 3: "User does onboarding"
> Frame 4: "User sees dashboard"
> Frame 5: "Success!"
> ```
>
> **Thursday Morning:**
> Designer: "What does 'does onboarding' mean? How many steps?"
> Writer: "What copy goes on the homepage? What's the value prop?"
> Stitcher: "Is there a welcome email between signup and onboarding?"
>
> **Thursday:** Team improvises. Different interpretations. Prototype doesn't flow coherently.
>
> **Friday:** Customers confused by the jumps. "Wait, how did I get here?"
>
> *Result:* Thursday chaos, Friday confusion, no clear signal.

**Correct (detailed storyboard):**

> **Wednesday Afternoon Storyboard:**
> ```
> Frame 1: Google search "project management for design teams"
> Frame 2: Landing page headline: "Finally, PM software designers actually like"
> Frame 3: Click "Start free trial" button
> Frame 4: Email capture + "What's your team size?" dropdown
> Frame 5: Confirmation email arrives (show subject line)
> Frame 6: Click email link → Welcome screen with video
> Frame 7: 3-step setup wizard - Step 1: Name your first project
> Frame 8: Step 2: Invite teammates (show actual UI)
> Frame 9: Step 3: Choose a template
> Frame 10: Dashboard view with sample project populated
> Frame 11: Click into first task → Task detail view
> Frame 12: Add a comment → See notification appear
> Frame 13: Success moment: "Project board with team engaged"
> ```
>
> **Thursday Morning:** Clear blueprint. Everyone knows exactly what to build.
>
> **Thursday:** Efficient division of labor. Prototype flows naturally.
>
> **Friday:** Customers can follow the experience. Feedback is about the concept, not the jumps.
>
> *Result:* Smooth Thursday, useful Friday, clear signal.

**Why it matters:**

A 15-frame storyboard takes 30-60 minutes on Wednesday. It saves hours of confusion on Thursday and ensures Friday's test has a coherent flow. Each frame should be specific enough that a stranger could build it.

**Storyboard checklist:**
- [ ] Specific screens, not concepts
- [ ] Actual copy, not placeholders
- [ ] Clear transitions between frames
- [ ] Shows the opening scene (how does customer find this?)
- [ ] Shows the success moment (what does "working" look like?)
