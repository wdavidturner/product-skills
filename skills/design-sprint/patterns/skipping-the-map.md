## Jumping to Solutions Guarantees Misalignment

The instinct is to skip Monday's mapping and jump straight to sketching solutions. But without a shared map, team members are solving different problems.

**Incorrect (skip to sketching):**

> **Monday Morning:** "We already know the problem. Let's start sketching!"
>
> **Tuesday:** Team produces 7 solution sketches. They're all over the place:
> - Designer sketched an onboarding flow
> - Engineer sketched a dashboard
> - PM sketched a notification system
> - Marketing sketched a landing page
>
> **Wednesday:** Heated debate. "These aren't even solving the same thing." Decider picks one, but half the team disagrees with the framing.
>
> **Friday:** Prototype tests poorly. Team argues about whether the problem was the solution or the problem definition.
>
> *Result:* No clear learning. Still misaligned on Monday.

**Correct (map first):**

> **Monday Morning:** "Let's map the customer journey before we solve anything."
>
> **The Map:**
> ```
> [New Customer] → [Hears about us] → [Visits site] → [Signs up] → [First task] → [Aha moment] → [Ongoing use]
>                                                              ↑
>                                                          TARGET
> ```
>
> **Expert Interviews reveal:** Most drop-off happens between "First task" and "Aha moment." Customers complete signup but never experience the core value.
>
> **Decider picks target:** "We're focusing on the transition from first task to aha moment."
>
> **Tuesday:** All 7 sketches address the same moment. Different approaches, but aligned problem.
>
> **Friday:** Clear signal on which approach helps customers reach the aha moment.
>
> *Result:* Aligned team, comparable solutions, actionable learning.

**Why it matters:**

The map does three things:
1. **Creates shared vocabulary** — everyone points to the same diagram
2. **Surfaces hidden assumptions** — expert interviews reveal what individuals know but haven't shared
3. **Forces a target** — the Decider picks one customer and one moment, so Tuesday's sketches are comparable

Without the map, you're comparing apples to oranges all week.
