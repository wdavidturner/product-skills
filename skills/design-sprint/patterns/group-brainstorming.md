## Work Alone Together — Individual Sketching Beats Brainstorming

Group brainstorming feels productive but generates shallow ideas dominated by the loudest voices. Individual sketching produces better, more developed solutions.

**Incorrect (group brainstorming):**

> **Tuesday Morning:** "Let's brainstorm! Everyone shout out ideas!"
>
> **What happens:**
> - Extrovert throws out first idea: "What about a dashboard?"
> - Everyone anchors on the dashboard concept
> - Introvert has a different idea but doesn't speak up
> - Ideas stay at the headline level ("gamification!" "AI!" "social features!")
> - Whiteboard fills with sticky notes, none fully developed
>
> **End of Tuesday:** 50 sticky notes, but no concrete solutions. No one knows what "gamification" actually means in this context.
>
> *Result:* Shallow ideas. Loudest voice wins. No real solutions to evaluate.

**Correct (work alone together):**

> **Tuesday Morning:** "We're going to work alone, in the same room, developing individual solutions."
>
> **Four-Step Sketch:**
> 1. **Notes (20 min):** Review Monday's map and expert insights. Jot down what stood out.
> 2. **Ideas (20 min):** Rough sketches of possible approaches. Ugly is fine.
> 3. **Crazy 8s (8 min):** Fold paper in 8, sketch 8 variations in 8 minutes. Forces rapid exploration.
> 4. **Solution Sketch (30+ min):** One detailed, 3-panel storyboard that's self-explanatory.
>
> **End of Tuesday:** 7 detailed solution sketches. Each is a complete concept that can be evaluated on its own.
>
> **What's different:**
> - Introvert's brilliant idea is on paper, not lost
> - No anchoring on the first idea mentioned
> - Ideas are developed, not just headlines
> - Anonymous sketches prevent politics and HiPPO (highest-paid person's opinion)
>
> *Result:* Diverse, developed solutions. Best idea wins, regardless of who proposed it.

**Why it matters:**

Research on brainstorming consistently shows groups generate fewer and less creative ideas than the same individuals working alone. The sprint's "work alone together" approach gets the benefits of individual creativity (diversity, depth) plus the benefits of the group context (shared information, time pressure).
