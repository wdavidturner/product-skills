## Write Sprint Questions Monday, Answer Them Friday

Sprint Questions frame what you're trying to learn. Without them, Friday becomes unfocused, and the team leaves without clear answers.

**Incorrect (no sprint questions):**

> **Monday:** Team maps the problem and picks a target. No explicit questions captured.
>
> **Friday Debrief:**
> PM: "I think that went well. Customers seemed to like it."
> Designer: "I'm not sure. Customer 3 was really confused."
> Engineer: "What were we trying to learn, exactly?"
> CEO: "Did we answer whether this is worth building?"
>
> **Team:** "...I guess? Sort of?"
>
> *Result:* Vague sense of success or failure. No clear decision criteria.

**Correct (explicit sprint questions):**

> **Monday:** After setting the long-term goal, team lists Sprint Questions:
> - "Will enterprise customers trust an AI to make decisions without human approval?"
> - "Can users understand the value prop in under 30 seconds?"
> - "Is the pricing model a barrier or an accelerant?"
>
> **Friday Debrief:**
> Facilitator: "Let's go through our Sprint Questions."
>
> **Q1: Trust AI?** "3/5 customers said they'd need human approval on big decisions. 2 said full automation is fine. Segment-dependent."
>
> **Q2: Understand value prop?** "4/5 got it immediately from the landing page. Customer 2 needed the demo video."
>
> **Q3: Pricing model?** "All 5 said pricing was fair. 3 said they'd need annual contracts for budget approval."
>
> **Decision:** "Value prop works. AI trust varies by segment — we need to offer approval workflows. Pricing is fine but we need annual options."
>
> *Result:* Clear answers to the questions that mattered. Concrete next steps.

**Why it matters:**

Sprint Questions turn Friday from "did they like it?" into "did we answer what we needed to know?" They're also useful for recruiting — you can screen customers to ensure they can answer your specific questions.

**Good sprint questions:**
- Specific and answerable with 5 interviews
- Address the biggest risks/unknowns
- Start with "Will...", "Can...", "Is..."
- Focus on behavior, not opinion
