## Give Teams Projects, Not Tickets

When you shred a project into 100 tickets, you lose the whole. Teams need to see the complete picture to make good trade-offs.

**Incorrect (the paper shredder):**

> **PM (after "shaping"):** "I've broken down the feature into 47 tickets. Each has acceptance criteria. Here's the sprint backlog."
>
> **Engineer:** "So I just work through these tickets?"
>
> **PM:** "Yes. Each ticket is independent. Just complete them in priority order."
>
> *Week 3...*
>
> **Engineer:** "I finished tickets 1-28, but the feature doesn't actually work. Ticket 31 depends on something in ticket 45, but ticket 45 depends on ticket 29 which I haven't started."
>
> **PM:** "How is that possible? We planned everything!"
>
> **Engineer:** "Also, tickets 12-18 turned out to be unnecessary once I understood the actual flow."

The work was decomposed by someone who didn't understand the implementation. The team lost sight of the whole.

**Correct (whole project ownership):**

> **PM (after shaping):** "Here's the shaped project. It's a 2-month dot grid calendar with a sliding agenda view and a create button. That's the whole thing. You make your own tasks."
>
> **Engineer:** "Got it. Let me break this into scopes..."
>
> *At kickoff, team maps 9 implementation scopes:*
> 1. Data model for events
> 2. Dot grid rendering
> 3. Month navigation
> 4. Day tap interaction
> 5. Agenda slide animation
> 6. Event creation form
> 7. Connect agenda to data
> 8. Mobile responsiveness
> 9. Edge cases (empty states, loading)
>
> **Engineer:** "I'll start with the data model and grid. I can see how it all connects."

The team owns the whole. They discover tasks as they build. They make trade-offs because they understand the goal.

**Why it matters:**

You're hiring professionals, not assembly line workers. When you give them the whole project, they're creatively engaged. When you give them tickets, they execute without thinking. The best engineers will leave if you treat them like ticket machines.
