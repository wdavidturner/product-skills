## Cool-Down Is Not Optional

Teams need breathing room between cycles. Skipping cool-down leads to burnout, accumulating debt, and declining quality.

**Incorrect (back-to-back sprints forever):**

> **PM:** "Great work shipping the calendar feature! New cycle starts Monday. Here's the next project."
>
> **Engineer:** "Wait, we just finished a crunch. Can we have a few days to—"
>
> **PM:** "No time. We're behind on the roadmap. Let's keep the momentum."
>
> *3 months later...*
>
> **Engineer:** "I haven't fixed any of the bugs from the last 3 projects. My code is getting worse because I never have time to clean up. I'm exhausted."
>
> **PM:** "We're shipping a lot though!"
>
> **Engineer (updating LinkedIn):** "..."

Continuous sprinting without recovery creates a death march. Quality degrades. Good people leave.

**Correct (scheduled cool-down):**

> **PM:** "Cycle ends Friday. We have 2 weeks of cool-down before the next cycle starts."
>
> **Engineer:** "Perfect. I'll use the first week to fix those three bugs that were bugging me. Second week I want to try a small experiment — a different caching approach."
>
> **Designer:** "I'm going to update our design system documentation. It's been out of date for months."
>
> **PM:** "Sounds good. I'll use the time to shape the next few pitches."
>
> *Next cycle...*
>
> **Team:** "We feel refreshed. The codebase is cleaner. We learned some things. Ready to go."

Cool-down isn't wasted time — it's investment in sustainability.

**Why it matters:**

Shape Up uses 6-week cycles with 2 weeks of cool-down (or 4 weeks on, 1 week off). Cool-down is when bugs get fixed, tech debt gets addressed, experiments happen, and people recover. Without it, you're just rebranding Scrum sprints and calling it Shape Up.
