## You Can't Fit 10 Pounds in a 5 Pound Bag

Throwing an oversized project at a team and saying "you only get 6 weeks" isn't Shape Up — it's cruelty. The shaping has to make the scope fit the time.

**Incorrect (oversized scope with arbitrary deadline):**

> **PM:** "We're doing Shape Up now! Team, you have 6 weeks to build the notification system. Use fixed time, variable scope. Good luck!"
>
> *Week 4...*
>
> **Team:** "We've built email notifications, but push notifications, in-app notifications, preference management, and the digest feature are all half-done."
>
> **PM:** "Just ship what you have!"
>
> **Team:** "None of it works together. We can't ship any of it."
>
> **PM:** "I thought you were supposed to cut scope?"

You can't cut scope into something shippable when the entire scope is interdependent. The project was never shaped — it was just time-boxed.

**Correct (shape scope to fit appetite):**

> **PM (in shaping session):** "We want a notification system. Our appetite is 6 weeks. What's a version that fits?"
>
> **Engineer:** "A full system with all channels, preferences, and digests? That's 3+ months minimum."
>
> **PM:** "What's the smallest valuable version?"
>
> **Engineer:** "Just in-app notifications. No email, no push. Just a bell icon with a dropdown. That's 3-4 weeks."
>
> **PM:** "Does that solve the core problem — users missing important updates?"
>
> **Designer:** "It handles the most common case. Email could be a separate bet later."
>
> **PM:** "Okay, we're shaping in-app notifications only. What are the moving pieces?"

The team has a real shot because the scope was negotiated to fit the time.

**Why it matters:**

Bob Moesta says it best: "You can't put 10 pounds of crap in a 5 pound bag." If the shaping didn't happen, the build team is set up to fail. Shape Up requires the shaping, not just the time box.
