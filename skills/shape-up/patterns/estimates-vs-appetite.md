## Appetite Over Estimates

Estimates answer "how long will this take?" which puts you at the mercy of scope. Appetite answers "how much time is this worth?" which puts you in control.

**Incorrect (asking for estimates):**

> **PM:** "We want to add a calendar feature. Engineering, how long will it take?"
>
> **Engineering:** "Let us analyze the requirements... We estimate 3 months."
>
> **PM:** "Okay, let's put it on the roadmap for Q3."
>
> *4 months later...*
>
> **Engineering:** "It's taking longer than expected. We need another month."
>
> **PM:** "But we already told stakeholders Q3..."

The estimate was wrong because you can't know everything upfront. Now you're trapped — cut scope and disappoint, or blow the timeline.

**Correct (setting an appetite):**

> **PM:** "We want to add calendar functionality. Leadership has decided this is worth 6 weeks max — that's our appetite."
>
> **PM (in shaping session):** "Given 6 weeks, what version of this can we confidently ship? What do we cut to fit?"
>
> **Engineering:** "If we do a full Google Calendar clone, no way. But if we focus on seeing empty spaces — a dot grid with agenda view — that's doable."
>
> **PM:** "That solves the core problem. Let's shape that version."

The appetite forces trade-offs upfront. You ship something valuable in predictable time.

**Why it matters:**

Estimates put the cart before the horse — you commit to scope before understanding it. Appetite flips the equation: commit to time, then shape scope to fit. Like buying a car with a budget instead of picking features and seeing what it costs.
