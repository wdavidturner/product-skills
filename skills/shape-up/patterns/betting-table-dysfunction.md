## Betting Is Not Backlog Shuffling

The betting table is where real commitments happen. It's not a ceremony to shuffle an ever-growing backlog.

**Incorrect (backlog with new packaging):**

> **PM:** "Time to plan the next cycle. Let's look at the backlog."
>
> **CPO:** "We have 47 items. Let's pick the top 6."
>
> **PM:** "These 6 were at the top last time too, but we didn't do them."
>
> **CPO:** "Right, priorities shifted. Let's pick them again and see if we get to them this time."
>
> *After the cycle...*
>
> **PM:** "We finished 2 of the 6. The other 4 go back in the backlog."
>
> **CPO:** "Okay. Next cycle we'll re-prioritize again."

The backlog grows forever. Nothing ever truly gets cut. Items cycle through repeatedly. It's prioritization theater.

**Correct (real bets, no backlog):**

> **CPO (at betting table):** "We have 3 pitched projects and 2 slots this cycle. What do we bet on?"
>
> **PM:** "The notification system pitch is solid. It's shaped for 4 weeks."
>
> **CTO:** "The performance optimization pitch is risky. We're not sure we can do it in 6 weeks."
>
> **CPO:** "Then we don't bet on it until it's better shaped. What about the onboarding pitch?"
>
> **PM:** "That one's tight. 3 weeks appetite, well-shaped."
>
> **CPO:** "We're betting on notifications and onboarding. The performance pitch needs more shaping. If nobody shapes it before next cycle, it's gone."
>
> **PM:** "What about all the other requests we've gotten?"
>
> **CPO:** "If they're not pitched and shaped, they don't exist at the betting table."

Betting is a real commitment. Unshaped work doesn't compete. There's no infinite backlog haunting the team.

**Why it matters:**

A backlog is a graveyard of unkept promises. Betting means if something doesn't get bet on, it goes away. This forces real prioritization — you have to shape work worth betting on, not just add items to a list and hope.
