## The Best Habit-Forming Products Start as Vitamins and Become Painkillers

"Vitamins" are nice-to-have products. "Painkillers" are must-have products. The best habit-forming products start as vitamins — users try them out of curiosity — and become painkillers through habit formation.

**Incorrect (only vitamin, never becomes painkiller):**

> **Meditation app:**
>
> Users download because meditation seems interesting (vitamin). They use it a few times, enjoy it, but don't form a habit.
>
> A month later, they haven't opened the app. They don't miss it. Life without the app feels the same as life with it.
>
> *Result:* High initial downloads, very low retention.

**Correct (vitamin that becomes painkiller through habit):**

> **Meditation app with habit formation:**
>
> Users download because meditation seems interesting (vitamin). The hook:
> - **Trigger:** Morning notification at consistent time, building association with "morning = meditation"
> - **Action:** One tap to start 5-minute guided session (minimal friction)
> - **Variable Reward:** Different guided content daily, streak milestones, progress tracking
> - **Investment:** Streak counter, mood tracking data, personalized content preferences
>
> After 30 days of consistent use, the user wakes up and feels *incomplete* without morning meditation. Missing a day causes discomfort. The product has become a painkiller.
>
> *Result:* Users who reach habit threshold have high retention and actively recommend the app.

**Why it matters:**

As Nir Eyal notes, you don't need to start with a painkiller — many successful products didn't. Facebook wasn't solving a burning pain. Neither was Instagram or TikTok. But once habits formed, users experienced pain when they couldn't access them. The goal is to shepherd users through enough hook cycles that the vitamin becomes a painkiller.
