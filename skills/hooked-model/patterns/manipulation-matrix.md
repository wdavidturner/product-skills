## Use the Manipulation Matrix to Evaluate Ethics

Before building or optimizing a hook, evaluate where you stand on the Manipulation Matrix. Your position determines whether you're building something ethical or exploitative.

**Incorrect (building without ethical evaluation):**

> **Mobile game team:**
>
> PM: "Let's add more variable rewards. Random loot boxes, daily login bonuses, limited-time events that create FOMO."
>
> Designer: "Should we be worried about addiction or exploitation?"
>
> PM: "That's not our concern. Our job is engagement metrics."
>
> *Never asked:* Does anyone on the team play this game? Does it improve players' lives? Would we want our kids playing it?
>
> *Result:* Engagement increases, but the team is building something they're not proud of. Eventually, regulatory or reputational consequences catch up.

**Correct (using Manipulation Matrix for evaluation):**

> **Mobile game team:**
>
> PM: "Before optimizing hooks, let's check the Manipulation Matrix."
>
> Questions:
> 1. **Do we use the product ourselves?** — Yes, several team members play daily.
> 2. **Does it materially improve users' lives?** — It provides entertainment and stress relief. Not life-changing, but genuinely enjoyable.
>
> **Position: Entertainer** — We use it, but it's not improving lives beyond entertainment.
>
> PM: "We're Entertainers. That's acceptable, but we need guardrails. Let's add spending limits, session time notifications, and ensure players can easily step away. We want players to enjoy the game, not regret it."
>
> *Result:* Sustainable business that the team is proud of.

**The Matrix:**

|                        | **Maker uses it** | **Maker doesn't use it** |
|------------------------|:-----------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Improves lives** | **Facilitator** | **Peddler** |
| **Doesn't improve lives** | **Entertainer** | **Dealer** |

**Why it matters:**

The Hooked Model is a power tool. Facilitators build helpful habits. Dealers exploit vulnerabilities. Know which you are, and be honest about it. If you're a Dealer, you're building something that will eventually harm your users, your reputation, or both.
