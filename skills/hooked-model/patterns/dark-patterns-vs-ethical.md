## Hooks Should Improve Users' Lives, Not Exploit Them

The Hooked Model is a tool. Like any tool, it can be used to help or harm. Ethical hooks create habits that improve users' lives. Dark patterns exploit psychological vulnerabilities for profit at users' expense.

**Incorrect (exploitative hook):**

> **Social media app design:**
>
> PM: "Users are leaving after 20 minutes. How do we keep them longer?"
>
> Designer: "Autoplay the next video. Remove stopping cues. Make it impossible to know how long they've been scrolling."
>
> PM: "Add fake notifications — 'Someone may have viewed your profile' — to create FOMO."
>
> *Result:* Users spend 2 hours instead of 20 minutes. They feel worse afterward. The product extracts value from users' lives rather than adding to them.
>
> **Manipulation Matrix position: Dealer** (doesn't improve lives, makers wouldn't use it this way)

**Correct (ethical hook):**

> **Language learning app design:**
>
> PM: "Users want to learn Spanish but struggle to stick with it. How do we help them build the habit?"
>
> Designer: "Trigger: The feeling of wanting to make progress. Action: 5-minute lesson — short enough that ability is high. Reward: Variable — sometimes streak bonuses, sometimes leaderboard movement, sometimes new content unlocked. Investment: Building streak history and skill levels."
>
> PM: "We should add usage reminders, but also 'You've hit your daily goal!' notifications that encourage stopping. We want users to succeed, not burn out."
>
> *Result:* Users build a language learning habit. They're grateful for the app. They recommend it to friends.
>
> **Manipulation Matrix position: Facilitator** (improves lives, makers use it themselves)

**Why it matters:**

As Nir Eyal says: "The vast majority of products out there, they're not worried about addicting anyone... They have a wonderful product that could really improve people's lives, but people aren't using it." Ethical hooks solve this problem. Dark patterns create a different one — extracting value from users who will eventually resent you.
