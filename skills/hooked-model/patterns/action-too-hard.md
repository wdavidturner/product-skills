## If the Action Requires Effort, the Habit Loop Breaks

The action phase must be the absolute minimum behavior in anticipation of reward. Every extra step, form field, or decision point is friction that breaks the habit loop.

**Incorrect (too much friction in the action):**

> **Fitness app onboarding:**
>
> User feels motivated to track a workout →
> Opens app →
> Asked to create account (email, password, confirm password) →
> Asked to set goals →
> Asked to input current weight and height →
> Asked to choose workout type from 15 categories →
> Asked to customize workout settings →
>
> *User closes app, motivation depleted.*
>
> **The loop never completes.** No reward is experienced, so no habit forms.

**Correct (frictionless action):**

> **Fitness app onboarding:**
>
> User feels motivated to track a workout →
> Opens app →
> One button: "Start Workout" →
> Timer begins immediately →
> Workout complete → reward (progress visible, achievement unlocked)
>
> Account creation, goal setting, and customization happen *after* the user experiences the reward — or are made optional.
>
> **The loop completes.** User experiences reward, making them more likely to return.

**Why it matters:**

Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Trigger. All three must be present simultaneously. High motivation can overcome low ability, but internal triggers often come with moderate motivation. If the action is hard, even motivated users won't complete the loop, and the habit never forms. Always reduce friction before amplifying motivation.
