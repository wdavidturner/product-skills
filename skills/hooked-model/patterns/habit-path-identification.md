## Find the Habit Path Before Optimizing

Before optimizing your hook, identify what behaviors lead to habit formation. The "Habit Path" is the sequence of actions that converted casual users into habitual ones.

**Incorrect (optimizing without understanding the habit path):**

> **Social app team:**
>
> PM: "Retention is low. Let's optimize the hook."
>
> Designer: "We'll improve onboarding, add more notifications, increase variable rewards."
>
> *Result:* Scatter-shot improvements. Some help, some don't. No clear understanding of what actually creates habitual users.
>
> *Six months later:* "We've tried everything. Some users become habitual, others don't, and we don't know why."

**Correct (identify habit path first, then optimize):**

> **Social app team:**
>
> PM: "Before optimizing, let's find the Habit Path. What do retained users do that churned users don't?"
>
> Data Analyst: "Looking at users who return daily after 30 days vs. users who churned:
> - Retained users connected with 7+ friends in the first week
> - Retained users posted content within 3 days
> - Retained users received at least 5 reactions on their first post"
>
> PM: "So the Habit Path is: Sign up → Add 7 friends → Post content → Receive reactions. Each step loads the next trigger."
>
> Designer: "Now we know exactly what to optimize:
> - Onboarding should focus on friend connections, not feature tours
> - Prompt first post before Day 3
> - Ensure first posts get visibility and reactions"
>
> *Result:* Targeted optimization that increases the percentage of users who complete the Habit Path.

**Why it matters:**

Without understanding the Habit Path, optimization is guesswork. With the Habit Path identified, every improvement can be measured against one question: "Does this increase the percentage of users who reach the habit threshold?" That's the only metric that matters for long-term retention.

**How to identify the Habit Path:**
1. Segment users by retention (retained vs. churned)
2. Compare behaviors in the first week/month
3. Identify the behaviors that differentiate retained users
4. Map those behaviors to the Hook cycle
5. Optimize to increase Habit Path completion
