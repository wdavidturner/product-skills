## Without Investment, Users Have No Stake in Returning

If users don't invest time, data, effort, social capital, or money into your product, they have nothing to lose by switching. Investment creates switching costs and loads the next trigger.

**Incorrect (no investment phase):**

> **News app user journey:**
>
> User opens app → Reads article → Closes app
>
> There's no investment. The user has no more reason to open *this* app than any other news app. Their experience tomorrow will be identical whether they return or switch to a competitor.
>
> *Retention problem:* "Users read one article and never come back."

**Correct (investment loads next trigger):**

> **News app user journey with investment:**
>
> User opens app → Reads article → Asked to "follow" this topic or author → Follows
>
> Now the product is *different* for this user. Their feed is personalized. Tomorrow, content they care about will appear. The investment (following) loaded the next trigger (relevant content to return for).
>
> *Additional investments that load triggers:*
> - Save article to read later → Creates reason to return
> - Share article → Notified when friends engage
> - Comment on article → Notified when others reply
> - Customize feed → Product becomes more valuable over time
>
> *Retention improves:* Each investment increases the probability of return.

**Why it matters:**

Investment differentiates your product from competitors over time. A blank Spotify is no different from a blank Apple Music. But after years of building playlists, training the algorithm, and connecting with friends, Spotify has *stored value* that makes switching painful. The investment phase is what turns a product into *my* product.
