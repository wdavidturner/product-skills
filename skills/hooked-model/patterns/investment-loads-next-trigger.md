## The Best Investments Create Reasons to Come Back

Investment isn't just about creating switching costs — the best investments actively load the next trigger, giving users a specific reason to return.

**Incorrect (investment that doesn't load a trigger):**

> **Photo sharing app:**
>
> User posts a photo → "Photo posted!"
>
> The investment (posting) doesn't create any reason to return. The user might check back out of curiosity, but there's no pull.
>
> *Result:* Users post, then forget about the app.

**Correct (investment that loads the next trigger):**

> **Photo sharing app with trigger-loading investment:**
>
> User posts a photo →
> - "We'll notify you when people react" — creates anticipation (internal trigger: curiosity)
> - Photo is now visible to followers — they may comment (external trigger: notification)
> - Algorithm now knows what content user creates — better feed tomorrow (external trigger: relevant content)
>
> The investment (posting) directly creates reasons to return:
> - Curiosity about reactions → internal trigger
> - Notification when someone comments → external trigger
> - Better content in feed → improved next experience
>
> *Result:* Users post, then check back repeatedly to see engagement.

**Why it matters:**

The Hook cycle is a loop, not a line. Investment should connect back to triggers, making the next cycle more likely. The user invests → trigger is loaded → user returns → user invests more → stronger trigger is loaded → stronger habit forms.

**Examples of investments that load triggers:**
- Following someone → Their posts trigger your return
- Creating content → Engagement notifications trigger your return
- Adding friends → Their activity triggers your return
- Saving preferences → Better recommendations trigger your return
- Building history → Personalized content triggers your return
