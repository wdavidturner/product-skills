## The Search for Resources and Information Drives Engagement

Rewards of the Hunt tap into our instinct to search for resources — information, material goods, or money. The variability of what we might find creates the compulsion to keep looking.

**Incorrect (no hunt dynamic):**

> **E-commerce app:**
>
> User opens app → Sees the same categories as yesterday → Browses predictably organized products → Nothing new to discover
>
> There's no hunt. The user knows exactly what they'll find. Without the thrill of discovery, there's no reason to return frequently.
>
> *Result:* Users only open the app when they have a specific purchase in mind.

**Correct (leveraging Rewards of the Hunt):**

> **E-commerce app with hunt rewards:**
>
> User opens app →
> - "Flash deals ending in 2 hours" — what might be on sale? (variable)
> - "Picked for you" based on unpredictable algorithm — what did it find? (variable)
> - "New arrivals" that change daily — what's new today? (variable)
> - "Limited stock" indicators — will it still be there? (variable)
>
> Each session brings the possibility of discovering something valuable. Even if the user doesn't buy, they experienced the hunt.
>
> *Investment:* Saving items to wishlist, following brands loads the next trigger (price drop notifications, new arrivals from followed brands).

**Why it matters:**

The hunt reward is why Twitter feeds are addictive, why Pinterest is a rabbit hole, and why people refresh news sites compulsively. The scroll isn't about what you find — it's about what you *might* find. Products that offer variable discovery create a reason to return even when users don't have a specific goal.

**Other examples of Hunt rewards:**
- Twitter/X timeline (what's happening?)
- Pinterest feed (what will I discover?)
- Google search results (what's the answer?)
- Deal sites like Slickdeals (what's the bargain?)
- Slot machines (will I win?)
