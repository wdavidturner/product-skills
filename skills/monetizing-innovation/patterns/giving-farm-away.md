## Don't Give the Farm Away in Your Entry Tier

20% of what you build drives 80% of willingness to pay. If you put that 20% in your free or entry tier, you've already lost the monetization battle — there's nothing compelling left to upgrade to.

**Incorrect (all value in the free tier):**

> A two-sided marketplace built a buy-side product. Internal teams brainstormed 40 features, prioritized to 10, and launched:
>
> Free tier: Core search, filtering, saved lists, basic analytics, messaging
> Pro tier ($29/mo): Advanced analytics, bulk actions, priority support
>
> Result: 95% of users stayed on Free. The "advanced analytics" weren't compelling enough because the free analytics were already good. The 20% of features driving willingness to pay were all given away.
>
> Team response: "Let's add more features to Pro!" But now they're chasing their tails — building the 80% that only drives 20% of willingness to pay.

**Correct (strategic feature gating):**

> Before building, the team tested willingness to pay on each feature:
>
> "Most important feature you'd pay for?"
> #1: Real-time price alerts
> #2: Historical pricing data
> #3: Bulk list management
>
> These weren't the most technically impressive features — they were the easiest to build. But they drove 80% of willingness to pay.
>
> Revised packaging:
> Free tier: Basic search, limited filtering, 5 saved items
> Pro tier ($29/mo): Unlimited saves, real-time alerts, historical data
> Business tier ($79/mo): Bulk management, team features, API access
>
> Result: 30% Pro conversion, 8% Business conversion. The free tier provides enough value to hook users but not enough to satisfy power needs.

**Why it matters:**

Once customers are trained to expect features for free, you can't take them back. You'll spend all your engineering effort building things customers don't value enough to pay for, while the high-value features generate zero revenue.
