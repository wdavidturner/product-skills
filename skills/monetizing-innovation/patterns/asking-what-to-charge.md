## Never Ask "What Should I Charge?"

Directly asking customers what you should charge produces garbage data. Customers don't know, they'll lowball, and it's your job to figure out — not theirs. Use indirect methods instead.

**Incorrect (direct pricing questions):**

> Interviewer: "We're building a project management tool. What do you think we should charge?"
>
> Customer: "I don't know... maybe $10/month? That seems reasonable."
>
> Interviewer: "Would you pay $20?"
>
> Customer: "Hmm, that feels expensive. $10-15 seems fair."
>
> Team concludes: "Customers want $10-15 pricing." They launch at $12/month and leave 3x revenue on the table.

**Correct (indirect and relative methods):**

> Interviewer: "If Asana is indexed at 100 for the value it provides, where would you rate what we just showed you?"
>
> Customer: "Maybe 120 — the automation features would save me more time."
>
> Interviewer: "And if Asana's price is indexed at 100, where should we be?"
>
> Customer: "Probably 110 — I'd pay a premium for those automations."
>
> Interviewer: "What would be an acceptable price for this? What would be expensive? What would be prohibitively expensive?"
>
> Customer: "Acceptable would be $25. Expensive would be $45. Prohibitively expensive would be anything over $60."
>
> Team now knows: They can price at $30-40 (the "expensive" range means neutral willingness to pay) and they're seen as more valuable than Asana.

**Why it matters:**

People are "absolutely meaningless, relatively super smart." They can't tell you what to charge, but they CAN compare your value to known references and identify when prices feel wrong. These indirect methods reveal what direct questions hide.
