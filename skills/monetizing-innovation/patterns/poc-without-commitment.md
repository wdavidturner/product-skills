## POCs Should Build Business Cases, Not Just Test Features

Most POCs (proof of concepts) are framed as technical validation: "Let's see if the product works in your environment." This misses the point. POCs should be framed as building a business case together — so when it's time to buy, the customer has already justified the investment.

**Incorrect (POC as feature test):**

> AI company offers a 30-day POC:
>
> Sales: "Let's run a pilot to see if our model integrates with your systems and performs well."
>
> 30 days later:
> Customer: "The integration worked. Performance was good."
> Sales: "Great! Ready to sign a $200K contract?"
> Customer: "Whoa. We need to build a business case internally first. Can you help with an ROI model?"
> Sales: [Creates ROI deck with assumptions customer disputes]
> Customer: "These numbers seem optimistic. We need to think about it."
>
> Deal stalls for 6 months.

**Correct (POC as business case co-creation):**

> Same company reframes the POC:
>
> Sales: "Let's run a 30-day pilot. The goal is to co-create a business case together. We'll agree upfront on what metrics to measure, and by day 30, you'll have YOUR business case for the investment — built on YOUR data."
>
> Week 1: Agree on metrics (time saved, error reduction, throughput improvement)
> Week 2-3: Run pilot, measure agreed metrics with customer's tracking
> Week 4: Co-create ROI model using measured results
>
> Day 30:
> Sales: "Based on the pilot, you saw 15 hours saved per week at $50/hour — that's $39K/year per user. With 20 users, that's $780K in value. Our ask is $200K."
> Customer: "That ROI was built on our numbers. I can take this to leadership."
>
> Deal closes in 30 days.

**Why it matters:**

If the customer agrees on the inputs (metrics, baselines, time tracked), they can't argue with the outputs. A POC that proves technical fit still requires a separate business case process. A POC that builds the business case does both — and qualifies whether the customer is serious (if they won't engage on metrics, they're a tire-kicker).
