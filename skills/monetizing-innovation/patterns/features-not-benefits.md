## Pitch Benefits, Not Features

What you build is features. What customers get is benefits. If you're excited about your technology and pitching how it works, you're talking features. Customers only care about outcomes.

**Incorrect (feature-focused communication):**

> Pricing page for a photo hosting service (actual example):
>
> **Pro Plan - $9.99/month**
> - 2TB cloud storage
> - RAW file support
> - 256-bit AES encryption
> - CDN distribution across 12 global regions
> - API access with OAuth 2.0
> - Batch upload up to 500 files
> - Custom metadata tagging
> - [15 more technical features...]
>
> Visitor scrolls through 3 pages of features before seeing the price. They're confused: "Is this for me? What do I actually get?"

**Correct (benefit-focused communication):**

> Revised pricing page (SmugMug after their transformation):
>
> **Pro Plan - $9.99/month**
> - Sell your photos online and keep more profit
> - Your photos load instantly for visitors worldwide
> - Unlimited storage — never delete a photo again
> - Share galleries privately with clients
> - Your site, your brand, your rules
>
> The features (CDN, storage limits, commerce tools) still exist — they're just explained in terms of what they do FOR the customer.
>
> Result: Double-digit revenue increase with zero product changes.

**Why it matters:**

Feature-focused communication signals you're more in love with your product than with solving customer problems. Benefits answer the only question that matters: "What's in it for me?" If you're not seeing traction, your pricing page is probably the first place to look.
