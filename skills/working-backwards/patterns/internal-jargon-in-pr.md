## Press Releases Are for Customers, Not Engineers

The internal press release is written as if for external publication. If customers wouldn't understand it, you don't understand what you're building for them.

**Incorrect (internal jargon):**

> **Press Release Draft:**
>
> **Headline:** "Amazon Launches ML-Powered Recommendation Engine v3"
>
> "Today, Amazon announced the launch of its next-generation ML-powered recommendation engine, leveraging our proprietary transformer architecture and real-time collaborative filtering pipeline. The system reduces latency by 40% while improving precision@10 metrics by 23%. Integration with the existing ASIN graph enables cross-category personalization at scale..."
>
> *What's wrong:* This reads like an internal tech spec. A customer reading this learns nothing about what's in it for them. "Precision@10" means nothing outside Amazon's ML team.

**Correct (customer language):**

> **Press Release Draft:**
>
> **Headline:** "Amazon Makes Finding What You Want Faster Than Ever"
>
> "Today, Amazon announced major improvements to product recommendations. Customers will now see suggestions that better match their interests — with recommendations that consider not just what you've bought, but what you've browsed, wishlisted, and searched for. In testing, customers found what they were looking for 25% faster, and discovered new products they loved twice as often..."
>
> **Customer Quote:** "I used to scroll past the 'recommended for you' section. Now I actually check it — last week it suggested a book I'd been meaning to read but forgot about. It's like it knows me." — Maria S., Chicago

**Why it matters:**

Bill Carr clarifies: "You try to write it in that way, but the one thing is you don't want to use hyperbole. It would be very factual with numbers, data rich document too. So again, not like a real press release. A lot of internal confidential data would be in this press release."

The document can contain internal data, but the *framing* should be customer-centric. If you can't explain it in words a customer would use, you haven't worked backward far enough.
