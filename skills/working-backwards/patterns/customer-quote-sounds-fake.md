## Customer Quotes Reveal Whether You Understand the Job

The hypothetical customer quote is a test: can you write something a real person would actually say? If it sounds like marketing wrote it, you don't understand your customer.

**Incorrect (corporate-sounding quote):**

> **Customer Quote in PR:**
>
> "Amazon's new inventory solution has revolutionized our business operations and enabled us to achieve unprecedented levels of efficiency. The seamless integration and robust feature set have exceeded our expectations and positioned us for sustainable growth in the competitive e-commerce landscape."
> — John Smith, CEO of ABC Commerce
>
> *What's wrong:* No human talks like this. "Unprecedented levels of efficiency"? "Positioned us for sustainable growth in the competitive e-commerce landscape"? This quote reveals that the author has never actually talked to the customer.

**Correct (sounds like a real person):**

> **Customer Quote in PR:**
>
> "Last month I oversold a product on Amazon because my Shopify inventory didn't sync in time. I had to cancel 47 orders, refund everyone, and my seller rating dropped from 4.8 to 4.3. With this tool, that doesn't happen anymore — inventory updates everywhere in under a minute. That alone is worth the price."
> — Maria Gonzalez, owner of HomeGoods Direct, a 3-person e-commerce business selling kitchenware
>
> *What's right:* This sounds like something a real person would say. It has specific numbers (47 orders, 4.8 to 4.3), a concrete pain point (overselling, rating drop), and a clear before/after. You can hear the relief in the quote.

**Why it matters:**

Writing a convincing customer quote requires you to actually understand:
- What problem they have (overselling, rating drops)
- How they talk about it (specific numbers, emotional stakes)
- What success looks like to them (not "efficiency" — "that doesn't happen anymore")

If you can't write this quote, you need to do more customer research before proceeding with the PR/FAQ.
