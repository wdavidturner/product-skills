## If You Skip the Problem, There Probably Isn't One

The problem paragraph is the most important part of the press release. If you can't articulate the customer's problem clearly and compellingly, you shouldn't build the product.

**Incorrect (skipping the problem):**

> **Press Release Draft:**
>
> **Headline:** "Amazon Launches Smart Photo Organizer"
>
> **Subheadline:** "New AI-powered tool automatically tags and organizes your photos"
>
> **Solution Paragraph:** "Smart Photo Organizer uses advanced machine learning to automatically detect faces, places, and objects in your photos. It creates albums automatically and lets you search your photos using natural language..."
>
> *What's missing:* There's no problem paragraph. The PM jumped straight to the solution.
>
> When reviewed by Jeff Bezos, his feedback was direct: "Maybe if you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem."

**Correct (leading with the problem):**

> **Press Release Draft:**
>
> **Headline:** "Amazon Launches Smart Photo Organizer"
>
> **Subheadline:** "Find any photo in seconds, even from years ago"
>
> **Problem Paragraph:** "The average American has over 2,000 photos on their phone, but finding a specific photo is nearly impossible. In a recent survey, 73% of people said they've given up searching for a photo they knew they had. Parents miss sharing memories because 'I know I have that picture somewhere but I can't find it.' The more photos we take, the less we can actually use them."
>
> **Solution Paragraph:** "Smart Photo Organizer solves this by..."

**Why it matters:**

The problem paragraph forces honesty. Bill Carr notes that "the heart of it really is that first paragraph... that second paragraph, that's the problem statement, and that third paragraph, that's the solution statement. If you wanted to ditch the rest of it and the artifacts of the press release, you could."

If you struggle to write a compelling problem paragraph, that's valuable signal — not an obstacle to route around.
