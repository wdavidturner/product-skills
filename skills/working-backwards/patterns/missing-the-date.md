## The Hypothetical Launch Date Signals Ambition and Scope

The press release includes a hypothetical launch date and location. This isn't just formatting — it communicates important information about the project's scope and ambition.

**Incorrect (missing or thoughtless date):**

> **Press Release Header:**
>
> "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE"
>
> or
>
> "SEATTLE — [DATE TBD] — Amazon today announced..."
>
> *What's wrong:* The date is missing or treated as a placeholder. This tells the reader nothing about when you think this could ship.

**Correct (intentional date):**

> **Press Release Header (simple feature):**
>
> "SEATTLE — March 15, 2025 — Amazon today announced..."
>
> *Signal:* This is a 3-month project. Relatively small scope.
>
> **Press Release Header (major initiative):**
>
> "SEATTLE — October 1, 2026 — Amazon today announced..."
>
> *Signal:* This is an 18-month project. Major investment. The reader knows to expect a larger FAQ section on resources, dependencies, and risks.

**Why it matters:**

Bill Carr notes: "The date is also a meaningful thing when you write the press release. The date is meant to be a hypothetical timing on which you're envisioning launching this thing which tells the reader something. Are you thinking that this is something that's so simple and easy, we're going to launch it next month or so complex that we're going to launch it in a year from now."

The date forces the author to make a commitment about scope. It also helps reviewers calibrate expectations: a 3-month project and an 18-month project should be evaluated differently.
