## One Press Release, One Compelling Benefit

A PR/FAQ should focus on one core benefit. If you find yourself listing multiple major features, you probably have multiple products. Split them up.

**Incorrect (feature soup):**

> **Press Release:**
>
> "Today, Amazon announces Super Seller Suite, a comprehensive solution for e-commerce businesses. Super Seller Suite includes:
> - Automated inventory syncing across channels
> - AI-powered pricing optimization
> - Customer service chatbot integration
> - Shipping rate comparison and label printing
> - Financial reporting and tax preparation
> - Review monitoring and response tools
>
> Each feature works seamlessly together to provide sellers with everything they need..."
>
> *What's wrong:* This is six products duct-taped together. Each of these could be its own PR/FAQ. Bundling them makes it impossible to evaluate: Is inventory syncing a good idea? Who knows — it's buried under five other things.

**Correct (focused benefit):**

> **Press Release 1: Inventory Sync**
>
> "Today, Amazon announces Inventory Sync, which keeps product counts accurate across Amazon, Shopify, eBay, and Walmart in real-time. Small e-commerce sellers with 50-500 SKUs spend an average of 12 hours per week manually updating inventory — and still oversell 3-4 times per month. Inventory Sync eliminates both problems..."
>
> *Separately:*
>
> **Press Release 2: Smart Pricing**
>
> "Today, Amazon announces Smart Pricing, which automatically adjusts your prices based on competitor prices, inventory levels, and demand..."

Each press release stands alone. Each can be evaluated independently. If Inventory Sync is approved but Smart Pricing isn't ready, you haven't lost anything.

**Why it matters:**

Bill Carr emphasizes creating a "product funnel, not a product tunnel." Bundling multiple ideas into one PR/FAQ makes it impossible to kill weak ideas while pursuing strong ones. You end up with an all-or-nothing bet instead of a portfolio of prioritized bets.
