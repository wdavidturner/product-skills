## Your Job Is to Care, Not to Be Liked

People-pleasers often fall into ruinous empathy because they equate being liked with being good at their job. The shift: your job is not to be liked. Your job is to genuinely care about people and help them succeed—even when that means saying hard things.

**Incorrect (optimizing for being liked):**

> Thinking: "If I give this feedback, they might not like me. They might push back. The team might think I'm too harsh."
>
> So you soften the message: "Things are mostly good! Maybe just a few tiny things to work on, no big deal."

You've prioritized your comfort and reputation over their growth.

**Correct (optimizing for their success):**

> Thinking: "This person wants to get promoted. They won't get promoted if they keep doing X. If I care about their success, I need to tell them clearly."
>
> Manager: "I want to talk about something because I know getting promoted matters to you. The way you've been handling client escalations isn't going to get you there. Let me be specific about what I've noticed..."

You've put their long-term success ahead of your short-term discomfort.

**Why it matters:**

Being liked in the moment often means being resented later—when they don't get promoted, when they get fired, when they realize you knew about problems and said nothing. Genuine care sometimes means being disliked in the moment to help someone succeed in the long run. That's the job.
