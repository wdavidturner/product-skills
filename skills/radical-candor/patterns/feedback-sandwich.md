## The Feedback Sandwich Backfires

The praise-criticism-praise approach (the "feedback sandwich" or less politely, the "shit sandwich") trains people to distrust your praise. When every compliment is followed by a "but," people stop believing you mean the nice things.

**Incorrect (sandwiching criticism):**

> Manager: "Great work on the project timeline—you really nailed the milestones. But the budget section was completely off and needs to be redone. Anyway, I love your attention to detail on everything else!"

The recipient hears: "Here comes the criticism" as soon as you start praising. The praise feels fake. The criticism gets buried. Nobody learns anything.

**Correct (separating praise and criticism):**

> On Monday:
> Manager: "I want to specifically call out how well you handled the project timeline. The milestones were realistic and the dependencies were clearly mapped. That's exactly what the team needed."
>
> On Wednesday, when reviewing the budget section:
> Manager: "The budget section has some serious issues. The numbers in Q3 don't match the staffing plan, and you're missing the infrastructure costs entirely. Let's walk through this together."

The praise is genuine and stands alone. The criticism is clear and actionable.

**Why it matters:**

When praise always precedes criticism, people learn to brace themselves whenever you say something nice. You've weaponized compliments. Worse, the criticism gets lost between two slices of hollow praise. Keep praise and criticism separate. Mean what you say.
