## Solicit Feedback Before You Give It

The order of operations matters: you cannot give feedback effectively until you've demonstrated you can receive it. Soliciting first builds the relationship and trust needed to make your feedback land.

**Incorrect (jumping straight to giving feedback):**

> In your first one-on-one with a new direct report:
>
> Manager: "I wanted to talk about some things I've noticed. Your emails are too long and you tend to ramble in meetings. I think you should work on being more concise."
>
> Employee (thinking): "Who is this person to tell me how to communicate? They don't even know me."

The feedback may be accurate, but without relationship, it won't land.

**Correct (soliciting first, giving later):**

> Over several one-on-ones, the manager asks: "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?"
>
> The employee gives feedback. The manager acts on it visibly.
>
> Later:
> Manager: "I've really appreciated you being candid with me about how I can improve. I want to be equally candid with you about something I've noticed..."

Now there's a foundation of mutual respect and demonstrated openness.

**Why it matters:**

When you solicit feedback first, you demonstrate that this is a two-way street. You show that feedback is about improvement, not judgment. And you build the relationship capital needed to challenge directly. Skip this step, and even well-intentioned feedback feels like an attack.
