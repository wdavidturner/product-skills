## Don't Ask "Why" — It Triggers Defensiveness

"Why did you do that?" puts people on trial. They'll justify, defend, and rationalize rather than reflect. Instead, ask what happened or what was going on.

**Incorrect (asking why):**

> Manager: "Why did you send that email to the whole company without running it by me first?"
>
> Employee (defensive): "Because I thought it was urgent and you were in meetings all day. I didn't think it was a big deal."

Now you're in an argument about whether it was a big deal.

**Correct (asking what happened):**

> Manager: "Walk me through what happened with the company-wide email. What was going on when you decided to send it?"
>
> Employee: "Well, the customer had escalated, and Sarah said we needed to communicate immediately. I looked for you but you were in back-to-back meetings, so I made a call."
>
> Manager: "I understand. In the future, even if I'm in meetings, ping me on Slack for anything company-wide—I can step out for 30 seconds. Now, let's talk about the content of the email itself..."

You've gotten the full picture without triggering defensiveness.

**Why it matters:**

"Why" implies judgment. "What happened" invites storytelling. Stories reveal context, pressures, and thought processes. You'll learn more, create less defensiveness, and still be able to address the behavior.
