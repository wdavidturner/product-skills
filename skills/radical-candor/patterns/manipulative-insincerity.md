## Manipulative Insincerity — When You Don't Say What You Really Think

This is where you land when you neither care nor challenge. You say what you think people want to hear, often to protect yourself rather than help them. It's the most corrosive failure mode because it destroys trust.

**Incorrect (saying what's convenient):**

> After a terrible presentation:
>
> Manager: "That was fine. Good job."
>
> (Thinking: "I don't want to deal with their reaction if I tell them the truth. Besides, it's not my problem to fix.")

Or worse, saying it behind their back:

> To a colleague: "Did you see that presentation? It was a disaster. I don't know how they thought that was ready."

**Correct (being honest, even when it's uncomfortable):**

> After the presentation:
>
> Manager: "I want to give you some honest feedback because I think it will help you. The presentation had some significant issues—the data didn't support your conclusions and the flow was hard to follow. I should have caught this earlier and helped you prepare. Let's debrief tomorrow and figure out how to approach this differently next time."

**Why it matters:**

Manipulative insincerity often feels self-protective in the moment—you avoid conflict, you avoid being the bad guy. But it creates a culture where no one trusts what anyone says. When you're nice to someone's face and critical behind their back, you're not protecting them—you're protecting yourself at their expense. And when they eventually find out (they always do), you've lost their trust completely.
