## Slack and Email Are Feedback Train Wrecks

You cannot gauge how feedback is landing through text. Without seeing or hearing the other person's reaction, you can't adjust when they look sad or mad. Asynchronous feedback is a train wreck waiting to happen.

**Incorrect (feedback via Slack):**

> Slack message: "Hey, wanted to flag that your report had a lot of errors and the conclusions didn't follow from the data. Can you redo it by EOD?"
>
> The recipient reads this and spirals: "Am I about to get fired? Does everyone think I'm incompetent? This is so unfair—I was given bad data!"

You have no idea how they're taking it. You can't soften, clarify, or gauge.

**Correct (picking up the phone):**

> A quick call: "Hey, do you have 5 minutes? I wanted to talk through the report before you finalize it. I noticed a few issues I want to make sure we address."
>
> On the call, you can hear their tone. If they sound defensive, you can pause and acknowledge their effort first. If they seem receptive, you can be more direct.

**Why it matters:**

Feedback always has emotional content. Text strips out all the signals that help both parties navigate the conversation. Phone beats video (research shows facial expressions create more noise than signal), and both beat text by miles. Never give substantive feedback asynchronously.
