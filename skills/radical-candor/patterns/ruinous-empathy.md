## Ruinous Empathy — When Being Nice Is Actually Cruel

This is the most common feedback failure—90% of mistakes land here. You care about someone SO much that you fail to tell them what they need to hear to succeed.

**Incorrect (protecting feelings over growth):**

> Bob hands in sloppy work. You can see the shame in his eyes—he knows it's not good enough.
>
> Manager: "Oh Bob, this is such a great start. You're so awesome. We all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better."
>
> Bob leaves thinking it's mostly fine. This repeats for 10 months.

Finally, you have to fire Bob. He asks: "Why didn't you tell me? I thought you all cared about me."

**Correct (caring enough to challenge):**

> Bob hands in sloppy work.
>
> Manager: "Bob, I want to be straight with you because I care about your success here. This work has several serious issues—the data in section 2 doesn't match section 4, there are formatting errors throughout, and the conclusion doesn't follow from the analysis. This isn't the quality I know you're capable of. What's going on?"
>
> Bob: "Honestly, I've been overwhelmed and rushing through things."
>
> Manager: "Let's figure out how to fix that. What would help?"

Now Bob knows exactly what's wrong, knows you're invested in his success, and has a chance to improve.

**Why it matters:**

You think you're being kind. You're actually being cruel. When you finally have to address the problem (or fire them), they'll feel betrayed—not by the feedback, but by months of silence. "Why didn't anyone tell me?" is the question that haunts managers who fall into ruinous empathy.
