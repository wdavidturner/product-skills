## Praise in Public, Criticize in Private

Criticism in public humiliates. The person can't process the feedback because they're managing their embarrassment in front of others. Praise in public amplifies the positive impact and models good behavior for the team.

**Incorrect (public criticism):**

> In a team meeting:
> Manager: "Before we move on, I want to address the issues with the product launch. Sarah, the marketing materials you created had multiple errors that went out to customers. We need to do better."

Sarah is now mortified. The team is uncomfortable. Sarah will remember the embarrassment, not the feedback.

**Correct (private criticism):**

> After the meeting, privately:
> Manager: "Sarah, I want to talk about the marketing materials. Several errors made it to customers, including the pricing typo. What happened, and how do we prevent this?"

Sarah can actually engage with the feedback without managing her public image.

**Correct (public praise):**

> In a team meeting:
> Manager: "I want to call out something Sarah did this week. When we discovered the pricing error, she immediately owned it, drafted the correction email, and set up a review process to prevent it happening again. That's exactly the kind of accountability we need."

The team sees what good looks like. Sarah feels recognized.

**Why it matters:**

Public criticism damages trust not just with the recipient, but with everyone watching—they're now wondering when they'll be called out. Private criticism creates psychological safety to actually learn. Public praise sets examples and builds culture.
