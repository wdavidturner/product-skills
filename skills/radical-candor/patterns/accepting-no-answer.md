## Never Accept "Everything's Fine"

When you ask for feedback and someone says "Oh no, everything's fine," you've just started. People are uncomfortable giving critical feedback, especially to their boss. Push past the initial deflection.

**Incorrect (accepting the brush-off):**

> Manager: "Do you have any feedback for me?"
> Employee: "Nope, everything's good!"
> Manager: "Great, thanks!"

You've learned nothing. The employee didn't feel safe enough to be honest, and you signaled that you'll accept non-answers.

**Correct (persisting past the deflection):**

> Manager: "What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?"
> Employee: "Hmm, I think everything's fine, really."
> Manager: [Closes mouth, counts to six in the awkward silence]
> Employee: "Well... actually, sometimes it's hard when you reschedule our one-on-ones."
> Manager: "Tell me more about that. What impact does that have?"

The six-second silence is uncomfortable, but almost no one can endure it. They'll say something.

**Why it matters:**

If you accept "everything's fine," you'll never get real feedback. People need to see that you genuinely want to hear it—which means sitting in the discomfort, asking follow-up questions, and visibly acting on what they tell you. If you give up at the first deflection, you're signaling that you don't actually want to know.
