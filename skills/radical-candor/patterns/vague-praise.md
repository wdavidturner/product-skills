## Vague Praise Teaches Nothing — Use CORE

"Great job!" feels nice but teaches nothing. If the purpose of praise is to tell people what to do MORE of, you have to be specific about what they did well. Use CORE: Context, Observation, Result, nExt step.

**Incorrect (vague praise):**

> After a successful client meeting:
>
> Manager: "Great job in there! You're a natural."

What exactly did they do well? What should they repeat? They have no idea.

**Correct (specific praise using CORE):**

> Manager: "**In the client meeting** [Context], **when the CEO challenged our timeline and you calmly walked through each dependency** [Observation], **it completely defused the tension and got us to alignment** [Result]. **That's exactly the kind of composure we need in those moments—keep doing that** [nExt step]."

Now they know exactly what worked and can consciously repeat it.

**Why it matters:**

Vague praise feels good for a moment but changes nothing. Specific praise is like a highlight reel—it shows people the exact moves that made them successful. Without specifics, people might attribute their success to the wrong thing or fail to recognize what actually worked.
