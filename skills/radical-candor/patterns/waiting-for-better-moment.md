## Waiting for the Right Moment Means Never

When you tell yourself "I'll wait for a better time to bring this up," what you're really saying is "I'm never going to say it." The right moment for feedback is now—or at least very soon.

**Incorrect (waiting for the perfect time):**

> You notice a problem in Monday's meeting. You think: "I'll bring it up at our one-on-one on Friday."
>
> Friday comes. The issue feels stale. "Maybe I'll wait until after the project wraps."
>
> The project wraps. "Well, it's too late now. I'll mention it if it happens again."
>
> It happens again. By now, it's a pattern you've allowed to develop.

**Correct (addressing it immediately):**

> After Monday's meeting: "Hey, do you have two minutes? I noticed something in the meeting I wanted to flag while it's fresh."
>
> You give the feedback. It's specific. They can immediately apply it.

**Why it matters:**

Feedback has a half-life. The longer you wait, the less useful it becomes. Details fade. The connection between behavior and consequence gets fuzzy. And if you're being honest, waiting for the "right time" is usually just fear dressed up as thoughtfulness. Give feedback now, or accept you're not going to give it.
