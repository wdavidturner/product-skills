## Gauge How It Lands — Watch for Sad or Mad

Feedback isn't a monologue. You need to watch how it's landing and adjust in real-time. When someone looks sad or mad, that's your cue to move up on the "care personally" dimension—but NOT to retreat on the "challenge directly" dimension.

**Incorrect (retreating when they react):**

> Manager: "The presentation had some real issues with the data analysis."
> Employee: [Looks dejected]
> Manager: "Oh, I mean, it wasn't that bad. It's no big deal really. Don't worry about it."

You've made them both sad AND confused. They don't know if there's a real problem or not.

**Correct (adjusting without retreating):**

> Manager: "The presentation had some real issues with the data analysis."
> Employee: [Looks dejected]
> Manager: "I can see that's hard to hear. I'm not saying this to criticize—I'm saying it because I know you want to nail these presentations, and I want to help you get there. Let me be more specific about what I noticed..."

You've acknowledged their emotion, reinforced that you care, and continued with the specific feedback.

**If they get mad:**

> Employee: "That's not fair! I was given bad data and an impossible timeline!"
> Manager: "I can hear you're frustrated. Maybe I'm not seeing the full picture—help me understand what happened. But this is important, so let's work through it."

**Why it matters:**

When someone looks sad, pulling your punches leaves them sad AND confused. When someone gets mad, retreating or fighting back both lose. The skill is staying connected (caring) while staying clear (challenging). Both dimensions matter, even—especially—when emotions run high.
