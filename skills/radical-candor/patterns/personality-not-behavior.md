## Criticize Behavior, Not Personality

"You're disorganized" attacks who someone is. "The report was missing three sections" addresses what they did. Personality criticism feels like a verdict; behavior criticism feels like coaching.

**Incorrect (criticizing personality):**

> Manager: "You're really disorganized. You need to get your act together."

The employee hears: "You are fundamentally flawed as a person." There's no clear action to take, and they're now defensive about their character.

**Correct (criticizing specific behavior):**

> Manager: "The last three reports you've submitted have been missing sections—last week it was the risk analysis, this week it was the budget breakdown. What's happening, and how can we fix this?"

The employee hears: "Here's a specific problem I can solve." They can address missing sections without feeling like they need to overhaul their personality.

**Why it matters:**

Personality criticism feels permanent and global ("I'm just a disorganized person"). Behavior criticism feels specific and fixable ("I need to add a checklist before submitting"). People can change behaviors; telling them their personality is the problem just makes them feel hopeless or angry.
