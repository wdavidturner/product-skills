## Obnoxious Aggression — Challenging Without Caring

When you challenge directly but forget to show you care, you put people into fight-or-flight mode. They literally cannot hear what you're saying—making your feedback useless AND harmful.

**Incorrect (challenging without caring):**

> Someone walks into a meeting and announces: "In the spirit of Radical Candor, your presentation was garbage. The data was wrong, the slides were ugly, and honestly I don't know how you thought that was ready to show the team."

This isn't Radical Candor. It's just being a jerk. The recipient is now defensive, humiliated, and has learned nothing they can actually use.

**Correct (challenging with care):**

> After the meeting, privately:
>
> Manager: "Hey, I want to talk about the presentation because I know how much work you put into it. The data in slides 4-6 had some errors that undermined your argument, and I think the design distracted from your main points. I can see this project matters to you—let me help you make the next version stronger. What support would be useful?"

The recipient knows specifically what to fix, feels supported rather than attacked, and is more likely to improve.

**Why it matters:**

Obnoxious aggression is inefficient—people in fight-or-flight can't process feedback. It's also harmful—you've hurt someone who may have been doing their best. And it often backfires: realizing you've been a jerk, you might overcorrect into ruinous empathy or manipulative insincerity, making everything worse.
