# Product-Led SEO

## What It Is

Product-Led SEO is a framework that treats SEO as a product discipline, not just a marketing tactic. The core insight: **SEO success comes from building products that serve searcher intent, not from creating content optimized for keywords.**

The traditional approach to SEO is "find keywords, write content, build links." Product-Led SEO asks: "What is the user searching for, and what product experience will satisfy that search?"

This framework was developed by Eli Schwartz, who helped companies like Zapier, Tinder, Quora, and SurveyMonkey build SEO strategies that generated hundreds of millions in revenue. The key shift: Move from "How do we rank for this keyword?" to "What product does this searcher need?"

## When to Use It

Use Product-Led SEO when you need to:

- **Decide if SEO is worth investing in** for your business model
- **Develop an SEO strategy** that actually converts (not just drives traffic)
- **Build programmatic pages** at scale (like Zapier, Zillow, or TripAdvisor)
- **Evaluate your SEO approach** in the age of AI Overviews and LLMs
- **Shift from top-of-funnel content** to mid-funnel conversion
- **Get product and marketing aligned** on search strategy
- **Understand the real ROI** of your SEO investment

## When Not to Use It

- **No SEO journey exists**: If users don't search for your solution (most B2B SaaS), SEO may not be the right channel
- **Committee decisions**: Enterprise sales with long buying cycles rarely convert from SEO
- **Brand-driven discovery**: If your product requires brand awareness first, invest in brand, not SEO
- **You need fast results**: SEO takes months to years; if you need revenue now, look elsewhere
- **Local businesses with no online transaction**: A pizza shop may not need a website at all

## Patterns

Detailed examples showing how to apply Product-Led SEO correctly. Each pattern shows a common mistake and the correct approach.

### Critical (get these wrong and you've wasted your time)

| Pattern | What It Teaches |
|---------|-----------------|
| [no-seo-journey](patterns/no-seo-journey.md) | Not every business should do SEO — validate the user journey first |
| [traffic-not-conversion](patterns/traffic-not-conversion.md) | Traffic is vanity — only measure what matters to the business |
| [blog-for-blog-sake](patterns/blog-for-blog-sake.md) | Content that doesn't convert is waste, not strategy |
| [copying-competitors-programmatic](patterns/copying-competitors-programmatic.md) | Zapier's strategy only works if you have Zapier's use case |
| [top-funnel-trap](patterns/top-funnel-trap.md) | AI Overviews will eat your top-of-funnel — move to mid-funnel |

### High Impact

| Pattern | What It Teaches |
|---------|-----------------|
| [seo-as-product](patterns/seo-as-product.md) | SEO pages need PM, design, and engineering — not just writers |
| [programmatic-without-use-case](patterns/programmatic-without-use-case.md) | Scale creates nothing if no one searches for what you built |
| [ranking-as-kpi](patterns/ranking-as-kpi.md) | Rankings don't pay bills — measure business outcomes |
| [wrong-funnel-position](patterns/wrong-funnel-position.md) | Match your SEO to where intent exists in the buyer journey |
| [link-building-vs-brand-building](patterns/link-building-vs-brand-building.md) | Guest posts on low-authority sites are waste — build brand instead |
| [ai-content-as-strategy](patterns/ai-content-as-strategy.md) | AI can assist content, but AI-only content is just faster spam |

### Medium Impact

| Pattern | What It Teaches |
|---------|-----------------|
| [technical-seo-overkill](patterns/technical-seo-overkill.md) | 100-page sites don't need enterprise-level technical SEO |
| [keyword-tool-truth](patterns/keyword-tool-truth.md) | Keyword tools are directional, not truth — they can be 10x off |
| [aeo-citation-strategy](patterns/aeo-citation-strategy.md) | In AI search, showing up as a brand beats showing up as a link |
