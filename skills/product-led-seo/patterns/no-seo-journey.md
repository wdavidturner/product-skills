## Not Every Business Should Do SEO

Before investing in SEO, validate that an SEO journey exists. If users don't search for your solution or wouldn't convert from a search, SEO is the wrong channel.

**Incorrect (SEO by default):**

> **Startup Planning Meeting:**
>
> CEO: "We just closed our Series A. What's the marketing plan?"
>
> CMO: "We need to invest in SEO. Everyone does SEO. Our competitors have SEO teams."
>
> CEO: "Great, let's hire an SEO person and an agency."
>
> *Six months later:* Traffic is up 40%, but zero leads came from organic search. The SEO investment generated content that doesn't connect to how customers actually find and buy the product.

**Correct (validating the journey first):**

> **Startup Planning Meeting:**
>
> CEO: "Should we invest in SEO?"
>
> CMO: "Let me check. Our product is enterprise security software. How do customers find us now?"
>
> Sales Lead: "They hear about us at conferences, get referred by peers, or see our content on LinkedIn. Then they request a demo, go through a 3-month evaluation, and need sign-off from IT, legal, and procurement."
>
> CMO: "So even if someone Googles 'enterprise security software' and lands on our site, they won't convert from that visit. The buying process is committee-driven."
>
> CEO: "Then let's invest that budget in the events and content that actually drive our pipeline."

**Why it matters:**

SEO is not free — it requires PM time, engineering, design, content, and tools. The question isn't "should we do SEO?" but "is SEO the best use of these resources?" For many B2B SaaS companies, the answer is no. The buying process doesn't support search-to-conversion.
