## Rankings Don't Pay Bills

Ranking #1 for a keyword is not success. Revenue from that ranking is success. Many companies optimize for rankings and forget to optimize for business outcomes.

**Incorrect (rankings as the goal):**

> **SEO Quarterly Review:**
>
> "We're crushing it! Look at our wins:
> - Ranking #1 for 'project management best practices'
> - Ranking #2 for 'how to run better meetings'
> - Ranking #3 for 'team collaboration tips'
>
> We've beaten Asana and Monday.com on these keywords!"
>
> *The uncomfortable question:* "How many of those visitors became customers?"
>
> *The answer:* "We... don't track that. But look at those rankings!"

**Correct (business outcomes as the goal):**

> **SEO Quarterly Review:**
>
> "Here's what our SEO actually produced:
>
> | Keyword | Ranking | Traffic | Signups | Paid Conversion |
> |---------|---------|---------|---------|-----------------|
> | project management tool comparison | #4 | 2,000 | 150 | 12 |
> | asana alternative | #6 | 800 | 95 | 8 |
> | monday.com pricing | #8 | 500 | 40 | 5 |
>
> Our 'best practices' content ranks #1 but produces zero signups. Our comparison and alternative pages rank lower but drive actual revenue. Next quarter, we're shifting resources to mid-funnel pages that convert."

**Why it matters:**

SEO teams often celebrate ranking wins without connecting them to business outcomes. A #1 ranking on a keyword that doesn't convert is worth less than a #5 ranking on a keyword that drives revenue. The metric that matters is always downstream: leads, signups, revenue. Rankings are an input, not an outcome.
