## Technical SEO Overkill

Small sites don't need enterprise-level technical SEO. Spending money on site speed optimization and crawl efficiency for a 100-page site is solving problems you don't have.

**Incorrect (technical SEO for a small site):**

> **SEO Audit Recommendations:**
>
> "For your 150-page SaaS website, we recommend:
>
> 1. Implement advanced crawl budget optimization ($15,000)
> 2. Build custom XML sitemap architecture ($8,000)
> 3. Deploy CDN for sub-100ms load times ($5,000/year)
> 4. Restructure URL hierarchy for maximum crawl efficiency ($12,000)
>
> Total: $40,000 to fix technical SEO issues."
>
> *Reality:* Google can crawl and index 150 pages in seconds. These optimizations matter for sites with millions of pages, not hundreds.

**Correct (right-sized technical SEO):**

> **SEO Assessment:**
>
> "For your 150-page site, technical SEO is likely not your bottleneck.
>
> Quick check:
> - Are all pages indexed? (Google Search Console)
> - Are there crawl errors? (Usually no)
> - Is the site reasonably fast? (Under 3 seconds)
>
> If yes to all three, your problem isn't technical. It's:
> - Content that doesn't match user intent
> - Missing mid-funnel pages where conversion happens
> - Not enough brand awareness to generate links
>
> Recommendation: Skip the $40,000 technical audit. Spend $5,000 on user research to understand what searchers actually need."

**Why it matters:**

Technical SEO matters at scale. TripAdvisor with millions of pages needs crawl optimization. Your 150-page SaaS site does not. Agencies sell technical audits because they're concrete deliverables. But fixing a problem you don't have wastes money that could go toward content or product work that actually moves the needle.
