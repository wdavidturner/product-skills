## Match SEO to Where Intent Exists

Different stages of the buyer journey have different search behaviors and conversion potential. SEO content must match where real intent exists.

**Incorrect (ignoring funnel position):**

> **SEO Content Calendar:**
>
> "Let's write about everything related to our space:
>
> - Week 1: 'What is inventory management?' (top funnel)
> - Week 2: '10 tips for better inventory' (top funnel)
> - Week 3: 'The history of supply chains' (top funnel)
> - Week 4: 'Why inventory matters' (top funnel)
>
> We'll cover the whole topic and become the authority!"
>
> *Result:* Lots of traffic from people casually researching. Zero traffic from people ready to buy. The content attracts tire-kickers, not buyers.

**Correct (matching content to intent):**

> **SEO Content Calendar:**
>
> "Let's focus on where buying intent exists:
>
> - **Mid-funnel** (comparing solutions): 'Shopify inventory apps compared: Skubana vs TradeGecko vs Inventory Planner'
> - **Mid-funnel** (specific use case): 'Inventory management for subscription boxes'
> - **Bottom-funnel** (ready to buy): 'How to migrate from spreadsheets to inventory software'
>
> We'll also build:
> - Calculator tool: 'How much is dead stock costing you?'
> - Comparison pages: 'Our tool vs [Competitor]'
>
> These attract people who need to make a decision, not just learn."

**Why it matters:**

Top-of-funnel content (awareness) attracts the largest audience but converts the worst. Mid-funnel content (consideration) attracts smaller but more qualified audiences. Bottom-funnel content (decision) has the smallest audience but highest conversion. Most SEO strategies over-invest in top-of-funnel because it has the highest search volume, missing that conversion rates matter more than traffic.
