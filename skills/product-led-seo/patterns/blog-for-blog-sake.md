## Content Without a Conversion Path Is Waste

Writing blog posts because "competitors have blogs" or "we need content" is not a strategy. Every piece of content needs a clear path to business value.

**Incorrect (content for content's sake):**

> **Content Strategy Proposal:**
>
> "Our competitors publish 20 blog posts per month. We need to match them to stay competitive in search.
>
> Proposed topics:
> - 'The Future of AI in Business'
> - '10 Productivity Hacks for 2024'
> - 'How to Build a Strong Company Culture'
> - 'The Importance of Work-Life Balance'
>
> Budget: $15,000/month for content production."
>
> *The problem:* None of these topics connect to the product. They're generic industry content that could appear on any website. Even if they rank, visitors won't convert because there's no logical path from "productivity hacks" to purchasing your specific solution.

**Correct (content with conversion intent):**

> **Content Strategy Proposal:**
>
> "Our product helps e-commerce brands manage inventory. Here's content that connects to actual buyer needs:
>
> - 'How to Calculate Safety Stock for Seasonal Products' (use our calculator tool)
> - 'Shopify Inventory Tracking: Built-in vs. Dedicated Tools' (we're a dedicated tool)
> - 'Dead Stock: How Much Is Hiding in Your Warehouse?' (leads to audit feature)
>
> Each piece targets someone actively trying to solve a problem our product solves. The CTA is natural, not forced."

**Why it matters:**

Content costs money — writers, editors, design, PM time. If that content doesn't connect to your product's value and doesn't have a conversion path, you're spending money to create assets that will never generate return. One converting page beats a hundred traffic drivers.
