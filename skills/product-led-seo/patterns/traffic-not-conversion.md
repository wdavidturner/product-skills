## Traffic Is Vanity — Measure What Matters

SEO success is not traffic. It's business outcomes. If your SEO drives millions of visits but zero conversions, you've wasted your investment.

**Incorrect (traffic as the metric):**

> **Monthly SEO Report:**
>
> - Organic traffic: 250,000 visits (+45% MoM)
> - Keywords ranking on page 1: 1,200 (+30%)
> - Domain authority: 58 (+3 points)
> - Blog posts published: 40
>
> "SEO is performing exceptionally well! Traffic is up significantly across all our content."
>
> *Meanwhile:* Zero MQLs attributed to organic search. The traffic is coming to blog posts about industry trends that have no connection to the product.

**Correct (business outcomes as the metric):**

> **Monthly SEO Report:**
>
> - Organic traffic: 85,000 visits
> - MQLs from organic: 340 (4% conversion rate)
> - Signups from organic: 2,100
> - Revenue attributed to organic: $45,000
>
> "Our SEO traffic is lower than last quarter, but we've refocused on mid-funnel content that converts. MQLs are up 60%."
>
> *The insight:* They deleted 200 blog posts that drove traffic but no conversions, focusing resources on pages that actually contribute to the business.

**Why it matters:**

No one pays for traffic. No one buys traffic. If your SEO drives visitors who never become customers, you've built an expensive content machine that feeds vanity metrics. The only metrics that matter are the ones that connect to revenue: MQLs, signups, purchases, pipeline.
