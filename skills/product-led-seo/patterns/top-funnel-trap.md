## AI Overviews Will Eat Your Top-of-Funnel

Google's AI Overviews and LLM search are disrupting top-of-funnel SEO. General information queries get answered directly in search results. Your content becomes input, not destination.

**Incorrect (doubling down on top-of-funnel):**

> **SEO Strategy for 2024:**
>
> "We're going to own the 'What is [category]?' queries. Our plan:
>
> - 'What is project management?'
> - 'What is a CRM?'
> - 'Guide to choosing business software'
> - 'Top 10 productivity tools'
>
> These are high-volume keywords. If we rank #1, we'll dominate the space."
>
> *Reality after AI Overviews:*
> - User searches "What is a CRM?"
> - Google shows AI Overview with complete answer
> - User never clicks any result
> - Your #1 ranking generates zero traffic

**Correct (moving to mid-funnel):**

> **SEO Strategy for 2024:**
>
> "AI Overviews will answer general questions. We need to target queries where AI can't fully satisfy the need.
>
> Instead of 'What is a CRM?', we target:
> - 'HubSpot vs Salesforce for startups' (comparative, needs specifics)
> - 'CRM for real estate agents with MLS integration' (specific use case)
> - 'How to migrate from spreadsheets to a CRM' (action-oriented)
>
> These queries have intent. The user needs to make a decision and take action. AI Overview might summarize, but it can't solve their problem."

**Why it matters:**

The search landscape is splitting. Top-of-funnel (information seeking) is being absorbed by AI. Mid-funnel (decision making) still requires clicking through because the user needs to take action — sign up, buy, compare specific options. Invest where the clicks will still happen.
