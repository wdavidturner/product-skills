## Link Building Is Brand Building

The old model of "buy guest posts on random sites" doesn't work. Real link building is brand building — earning mentions and citations because your brand matters.

**Incorrect (link building as a tactic):**

> **Link Building Strategy:**
>
> "We need more backlinks to improve our domain authority. Plan:
>
> 1. Buy 50 guest posts per month on sites that accept paid placements
> 2. Submit to 200 directories
> 3. Do 'link exchanges' with other sites in our space
> 4. Hire a link building agency at $5,000/month
>
> Target: 200 new backlinks per quarter."
>
> *Reality:*
> - Guest posts on sites no one reads provide no value
> - Google recognizes link schemes and discounts or penalizes them
> - Directory submissions are ignored
> - You've spent $15,000 on links that don't move the needle

**Correct (brand building that earns links):**

> **Brand Strategy That Generates Links:**
>
> "Links come from being worth linking to. Our plan:
>
> 1. **Original research**: Annual industry survey that gets cited by journalists
> 2. **Tools people share**: Free calculator that solves a real problem
> 3. **Expert positioning**: CEO speaks at conferences, gets quoted in articles
> 4. **Remarkable product**: Do something noteworthy that generates press
>
> We don't buy links. We become the brand people link to naturally."
>
> *Result:* One piece of original research generates 100+ links from legitimate sites. The free tool gets mentioned in Reddit threads and blog posts. This is sustainable authority.

**Why it matters:**

Google can detect unnatural link patterns. An algorithm that uses links as a ranking signal must account for manipulation. The sustainable approach is building a brand worth mentioning. This is harder than buying guest posts but creates durable competitive advantage.
