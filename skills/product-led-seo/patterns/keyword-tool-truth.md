## Keyword Tools Are Directional, Not Truth

Keyword research tools (Ahrefs, Semrush, etc.) are useful for understanding patterns but can be off by 10x in either direction. Don't treat their numbers as ground truth.

**Incorrect (keyword tools as truth):**

> **Keyword Research Findings:**
>
> "Semrush shows 'project management software' has 50,000 searches/month. If we rank #1 and get 30% CTR, that's 15,000 visits/month.
>
> Our forecast: 15,000 visits x 2% conversion = 300 signups/month from this single keyword.
>
> Investment justified!"
>
> *Reality after ranking #1:*
> - Actual searches: 8,000/month (Semrush was 6x high)
> - Actual CTR: 12% (AI Overviews took clicks)
> - Actual visits: 960/month
> - Forecast was off by 15x

**Correct (using tools directionally):**

> **Keyword Research Approach:**
>
> "Keyword tools are useful for:
> - **Relative comparison**: Is 'project management software' bigger than 'task management app'? Probably yes.
> - **Discovering variations**: What related terms exist?
> - **Understanding intent**: What are people actually searching for?
>
> But the numbers themselves are estimates. We can't build a forecast on them.
>
> Better approach:
> 1. Use tools to identify opportunities directionally
> 2. Build a test page and measure real traffic
> 3. Use Google Search Console for actual data
> 4. Forecast from real performance, not tool estimates"

**Why it matters:**

Building business cases on keyword tool numbers leads to bad decisions. Teams commit resources based on forecasts that are fundamentally unreliable. Use the tools to understand the landscape, but validate with real data before committing significant investment.
