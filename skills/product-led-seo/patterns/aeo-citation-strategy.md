## In AI Search, Brand Beats Links

When LLMs and AI Overviews summarize search results, showing up as a recommended brand matters more than showing up as a source link. Citations get scraped; brands get recommended.

**Incorrect (optimizing for AI citations):**

> **AEO Strategy:**
>
> "We need to optimize our content so AI Overviews cite us more often.
>
> Plan:
> - Add more structured data
> - Write content that answers questions directly
> - Format for AI extraction
>
> Goal: Get our URL to appear in the sources."
>
> *Result:* AI scrapes your content, uses your information, and users see Google's summary. Your URL appears as a tiny source link that few people click. You've helped train the AI but gained little traffic.

**Correct (building brand presence):**

> **AEO Strategy:**
>
> "When someone asks an LLM 'What's the best CRM for startups?', we want to be mentioned by name in the answer.
>
> Plan:
> - Build brand awareness so we're discussed on Reddit, YouTube, and industry blogs
> - Get mentioned in comparison articles and reviews
> - Create remarkable features that people talk about
> - Focus on PR and brand marketing alongside SEO
>
> The goal isn't to be a source link — it's to be the answer. 'For startups, [Our Brand] is often recommended because...'"

**Why it matters:**

LLM answers are summaries of many sources. Being one source among many is low value. Being the recommended brand in the answer is high value. This shifts SEO strategy toward brand building and earning genuine recommendations, not just optimizing content for extraction.
