## Start with the Shift, Not Your Solution

Leading with your product puts you in feature comparison mode from the start. You become just another vendor pitching capabilities.

**Incorrect (leading with product):**

> **Slide 1:** "Acme is the leading AI-powered customer success platform"
>
> **Slide 2:** "We help companies reduce churn with predictive analytics, automated health scoring, and intelligent playbooks"
>
> **Slide 3:** "Why Acme is better than competitors..."

The prospect immediately thinks: "Great, another vendor. How does this compare to what we have?"

**Correct (leading with shift):**

> **Slide 1:** "Customer success used to be reactive — wait for problems, then scramble to save accounts"
>
> **Slide 2:** "Winning companies have shifted to proactive success — seeing churn signals months before customers leave"
>
> **Slide 3:** "Look who's already made the shift: Slack, Zoom, HubSpot — they're not waiting for fires anymore"
>
> **Later:** "Here's how Acme helps you play this new game..."

The prospect thinks: "Am I playing the old game? I should be playing the new one."

**Why it matters:**

When you lead with product, you're the arrogant doctor diagnosing and prescribing. When you lead with the shift, you're the guide helping them join a movement they want to be part of.
