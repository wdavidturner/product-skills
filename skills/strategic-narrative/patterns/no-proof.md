## Show Winners Already Playing the New Game

Claiming a shift without proof makes it your opinion. Showing companies already winning makes it inevitable.

**Incorrect (shift without proof):**

> "We believe the future is proactive customer success. Companies should be predicting churn, not reacting to it.
>
> Our platform helps you do that."

This sounds like vendor marketing. "We believe" signals opinion. Where's the evidence this shift is real?

**Correct (shift with proof):**

> "Look at the companies dominating SaaS retention right now:
> - **Slack:** Reduced churn 40% by predicting at-risk accounts 90 days out
> - **Zoom:** CS team intercepts problems before customers notice
> - **HubSpot:** Publishes proactive success as a core company value
>
> These aren't experiments. This is how winners operate now.
>
> Meanwhile, companies still in reactive mode are struggling. [Show contrasting examples or industry data.]"

The shift becomes a fact, not a claim. These companies aren't using your product (necessarily) — they're playing the new game. That's the point.

**Types of proof:**
- Named companies winning the new game
- Industry statistics showing the trend
- Contrasting winners vs. losers
- Your own customer success stories (saved for later in the narrative)

**Why it matters:**

Proof transforms "here's what we think" into "here's what's happening." Prospects don't want to be pioneers — they want to join a movement that's already winning.
