## Name the Old Game and New Game Concretely

A vague shift doesn't create camps. If you can't name both sides in 2-4 words, you haven't found your shift yet.

**Incorrect (vague shift):**

> "The world is changing faster than ever. Digital transformation is reshaping every industry. Companies need to adapt or die."
>
> "Traditional approaches don't work anymore. We need to embrace innovation and be more agile."

What's the old game? "Traditional approaches." What's the new game? "Being agile." These are so broad they mean nothing. No one can disagree, which means no one will care.

**Correct (concrete shift):**

> **Old Game → New Game:**
> - "Software → Cloud" (Salesforce)
> - "Transactions → Subscriptions" (Zuora)
> - "Opinions → Reality" (Gong)
> - "Top-down learning → Upskill from within" (360Learning)
> - "Later → Now" (Drift)

Each of these creates two clear camps. You either see yourself in the old game or the new game. There's a choice to be made.

**Test your shift:** Can someone disagree with it? If everyone nods along but nothing changes, your shift is too vague. "Transactions → Subscriptions" is bold enough that someone could say "Actually, I think transactions are fine." That's a real shift.

**Why it matters:**

A bold, concrete shift polarizes — and that's the point. You want prospects to self-select. Those playing the old game aren't your customers anyway. Those ready for the new game will lean in.
