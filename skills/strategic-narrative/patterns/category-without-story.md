## A Category Name Without Narrative Falls Flat

Having a clever category name like "revenue intelligence" or "collaborative learning" means nothing if there's no story explaining why that category matters.

**Incorrect (category without story):**

> "360Learning is the leader in Collaborative Learning.
>
> Our platform enables collaborative course creation, peer-to-peer knowledge sharing, and social learning experiences."

The prospect thinks: "Okay, so you're a learning platform. What makes 'collaborative' different from what I already have?"

The category name becomes just a label. It doesn't create urgency or differentiation.

**Correct (category with story):**

> "Learning in companies used to be top-down: L&D creates content, pushes it to employees. Call it the 'training department knows best' model.
>
> But look at the winners — Google, Airbnb — they've flipped this. Their experts teach each other. They upskill from within.
>
> McDonald's France is recruiting with this: 'Learn from everyone on your team.'
>
> We call this Collaborative Learning. It's not just a feature — it's a fundamentally different game."

Now "collaborative learning" means something. It's shorthand for a shift the prospect understands and wants to be part of.

**The key insight:** Amit Bendov at Gong said they could have called their category "strawberry intelligence" — the name didn't matter as much as the story behind it. Category names are shorthand; the narrative is what makes them stick.

**Why it matters:**

Category names without stories invite the question: "How are you different from [competitor]?" Category names with stories invite: "Are we playing the new game yet?"
