## The Shift Must Resonate with Their Experience

Your shift might be real, but if prospects don't feel it in their day-to-day lives, it won't create urgency.

**Incorrect (shift they don't feel):**

> "The world is moving from fragmented data ecosystems to unified data platforms. Winning companies have centralized their data infrastructure."

This might be true, but if you're talking to a VP of Sales, they don't experience "fragmented data ecosystems." They experience "I can't get the reports I need."

**Correct (shift they feel):**

> "Sales used to run on gut and opinions. Your best reps had intuition about deals. You trusted their instincts.
>
> But now the winners — Gong, Salesforce, HubSpot — they see exactly what's happening in every deal. Reality, not opinions.
>
> Are you still running on gut? Or can you see what's actually happening in your pipeline?"

This connects to their daily experience. They *know* they're relying on gut sometimes. They've *felt* the uncertainty.

**How to test if they feel the shift:**

Ask in sales conversations: "Am I crazy, or are you seeing this?" Watch for:
- "Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us..."
- Nodding, leaning in
- Sharing their own examples

If you get blank stares or polite agreement with no engagement, the shift isn't landing.

**Finding a shift they feel:**
- Interview recent customers: "What was going on when you started looking?"
- Listen for their words, not industry jargon
- The shift should describe something they complain about at dinner

**Why it matters:**

A shift they don't feel is just another vendor's marketing claim. A shift they feel becomes their story — and they'll tell it to everyone else involved in the buying decision.
