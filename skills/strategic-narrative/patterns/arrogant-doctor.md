## Don't Pitch Like an Arrogant Doctor

The traditional pitch structure is "you have a problem, I have a solution, here's why mine is best." This is the arrogant doctor: diagnosing your condition and prescribing treatment.

**Incorrect (arrogant doctor):**

> "Your customer success team is struggling with reactive firefighting. Accounts churn before you know they're at risk.
>
> Acme solves this with AI-powered predictions, automated playbooks, and real-time health scores.
>
> Here's why we're better than Gainsight and ChurnZero:
> - More accurate predictions
> - Faster implementation
> - Better support"

You've positioned yourself as a vendor competing on features. The prospect's mental model is: "Which treatment should I buy?"

**Correct (movement leader):**

> "Customer success used to be reactive — wait for problems, then scramble. That was the old game.
>
> The new game? Proactive success. Seeing churn signals months before customers leave. Companies like Slack and Zoom are already there.
>
> The question is: what would it take for you to see churn before it happens? That's what we help you answer.
>
> Here are the obstacles in your way... and here's how we help you overcome them."

You've positioned yourself as a guide to a promised land. The prospect's mental model is: "How do I win the new game?"

**The key difference:** Arrogant doctors compete with other doctors. Movement leaders create a category of one.

**Why it matters:**

The arrogant doctor structure invites feature comparison. The movement leader structure invites: "Are we in or out?" That's a fundamentally different conversation.
