## The Promised Land is an Outcome, Not Features

The object of the new game should be aspirational — something worth striving for. If it sounds like a product spec, you've confused your capabilities with your customer's goals.

**Incorrect (features as promised land):**

> "What we help you achieve:
> - AI-powered analytics
> - Automated health scoring
> - Intelligent playbook execution
> - Real-time dashboards"

These are capabilities, not outcomes. No customer wakes up wanting "intelligent playbook execution." They want to stop losing customers.

**Correct (outcome as promised land):**

> "The object of the new game: **See churn before it happens.**
>
> What would it take to know — three months in advance — which customers are at risk? That's the question winning companies are asking.
>
> When you can see the future, you can change it."

The features (AI analytics, health scoring) become *how you get there*, not *where you're going*.

**Good objects sound like missions:**
- "Turn customers into subscribers" (Zuora)
- "Belong anywhere" (Airbnb)
- "Goodbye opinions, hello reality" (Gong)
- "Turn experts into champions" (360Learning)

**Test your object:** Is it asymptotically unachievable? You should always be pursuing it, never quite arriving. "Belong anywhere" is a journey, not a destination.

**Why it matters:**

Features are forgettable. A compelling object becomes a rallying cry — for your customers, your team, your company. It's the test for every product decision: "Does this help customers [object]?"
