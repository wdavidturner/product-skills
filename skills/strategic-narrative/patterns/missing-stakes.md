## Without Stakes, There's No Urgency to Act

If the shift sounds interesting but optional, prospects will say "that's nice" and do nothing. Stakes make it feel like life or death.

**Incorrect (no stakes):**

> "Companies are shifting from reactive to proactive customer success. This is an interesting trend we're seeing across the industry."
>
> *Prospect thinks:* "Huh, interesting. Maybe we'll look at that someday. What's next on my calendar?"

There's no cost to playing the old game. No urgency. No reason to act now.

**Correct (clear stakes):**

> "Look at the companies winning in SaaS right now: Slack, Zoom, HubSpot. What do they have in common? They saw churn coming months before it happened.
>
> Meanwhile, companies still playing the reactive game? Their churn rates are 2x higher. NetSuite just laid off 40% of their CS team trying to catch up.
>
> Fortune 500 survival rates are dropping. Companies that can't see what's coming? They're the next casualties."
>
> *Prospect thinks:* "Are we playing the old game? We might be the next casualty."

This is the Luke Skywalker moment. Until the aunt and uncle die, Luke says "I can't really get involved." Once stakes are life-and-death, he's ready to act.

**Why it matters:**

Stakes create the emotional energy needed for change. Show winners thriving in the new game and losers failing in the old one. Make playing the old game feel dangerous.
