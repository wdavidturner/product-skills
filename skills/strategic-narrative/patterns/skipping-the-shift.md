## Even Known Shifts Need Articulation

Don't assume prospects already understand the shift. Even obvious shifts need to be stated explicitly to frame everything that follows.

**Incorrect (skipping the shift):**

> "Everyone knows AI is transforming customer success. So let me just show you our product..."
>
> [Jumps straight to features and demo]

You've assumed alignment. The prospect might agree AI is important but have a completely different mental model of what that means.

**Correct (articulating even known shifts):**

> "We're in a shift. Customer success used to be reactive — wait for churn signals, then scramble. Call it the 'firefighting' model.
>
> AI hasn't just made that model faster. It's enabled something fundamentally different: seeing the future. Predicting churn before it happens.
>
> That's a different game — proactive success. Let me show you who's already playing it..."

Even if the prospect "knows" about AI, you've now framed *what the shift means for them*. Everyone's on the same page.

**Why it matters even when the shift seems obvious:**
- It establishes shared vocabulary
- It signals you're not just another vendor in the space
- It frames everything that follows
- It lets the prospect self-select ("yes, I want to play that game")

**Why it matters:**

Skipping the shift means you and the prospect might be talking about different things. The two minutes you spend articulating it ensures alignment for the next thirty.
