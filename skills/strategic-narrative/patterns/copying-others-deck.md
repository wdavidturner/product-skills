## You Can't Just Copy Someone Else's Deck

The Zuora deck is famous. Many companies have tried to succeed by just swapping in their logo. This never works.

**Incorrect (copying the template):**

> **Company sees Zuora's deck:**
> - "Old game → New game"
> - Here are the winners
> - Here are the obstacles
> - Here's how we help
>
> **Company's attempt:**
> - "Let me find an old game and new game for us"
> - "Let me find some winners to list"
> - "What obstacles should we put here?"
> - Fills in the template

The deck looks structurally correct but feels generic. The shift doesn't resonate. The proof feels forced.

**Correct (building from customer reality):**

> **Company's process:**
> 1. Interview 10-12 recent customers: "What was happening when you started looking?"
> 2. Listen for patterns: What old approach were they abandoning?
> 3. Name the shift in their words
> 4. Find proof that this shift is real in the market
> 5. Test it: "Am I crazy, or are you seeing this?"
> 6. Structure follows from content

The deck structure might look similar, but the content is authentically yours. The shift came from customer conversations. The proof is real.

**Why copying fails:**
- Your market isn't Zuora's market
- The shift must be authentic to your customers' experience
- Forced analogies feel like marketing speak
- No testing means no validation

**Why it matters:**

The framework provides structure, not content. The content must come from understanding your customers' world — what they're leaving behind and what they're trying to achieve. That can't be copied from a template.
