## Obstacles Are Barriers to the Promised Land, Not Pain Points

Traditional pitches start with "pain points" — problems the customer has today. Strategic narrative reframes these as obstacles standing between the customer and the promised land.

**Incorrect (pain points):**

> "Common problems our customers face:
> - Manual processes eat up hours every week
> - No visibility into what's working
> - Siloed data across departments
> - Compliance headaches"

These are real problems, but they're floating in space. Why should I care about fixing them *right now*? They've existed for years.

**Correct (obstacles to promised land):**

> "You want to turn customers into subscribers. But here's what's in your way:
>
> **Obstacle:** How do you track lifetime value when you've only measured transactions?
>
> **Obstacle:** How do you capture changing preferences over ongoing relationships?
>
> **Obstacle:** How does your billing system handle subscriptions when it's built for one-time purchases?"

Same underlying challenges, but now they're *obstacles preventing you from winning*. You've already established that winning matters (stakes). Now these obstacles feel urgent.

**The difference is context:** Pain points ask "does this hurt?" Obstacles ask "what's stopping you from getting to the promised land you now want?"

**Why it matters:**

Pain points can be endured indefinitely. Obstacles are things you need to overcome *now* if you want to win the new game. The emotional weight of the shift and stakes carries into how obstacles feel.
