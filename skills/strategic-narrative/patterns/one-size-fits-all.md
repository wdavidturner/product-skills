## Same Structure, Different Emphasis for Different Audiences

The five elements stay the same, but how you emphasize them changes based on who you're talking to.

**Incorrect (same pitch for everyone):**

> Using the exact same deck, with the same emphasis, for:
> - A sales call with a VP of Customer Success
> - A board meeting with investors
> - A recruiting conversation with an engineering lead
> - A conference keynote

Each audience cares about different aspects of the story.

**Correct (adapted emphasis):**

**Same narrative, different emphasis:**

| Audience | Lead with | Emphasize | Proof they want |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Sales (VP CS)** | Their day-to-day reality of the shift | Obstacles they personally face | Customer success stories like theirs |
| **Executives (CRO/CEO)** | Market stakes and competitive pressure | Business outcomes of the object | Revenue/retention metrics |
| **Investors** | Market size and inevitability of shift | Why you'll win this game | Traction as proof of movement |
| **Recruits** | Mission and meaning | Why this movement matters | Team culture, who else joined |

**Example shift:** "Reactive → Proactive Customer Success"

- **To VP CS:** "You're probably spending 80% of your time firefighting. Winning CS teams have flipped that."
- **To CRO:** "Companies with proactive CS have 40% lower churn. That's a retention moat."
- **To investors:** "The $50B customer success market is shifting. We're leading it."
- **To recruits:** "We're building the future of how companies keep customers. It's a mission worth joining."

**Why it matters:**

One narrative doesn't mean one presentation. The strategic narrative is your north star; how you tell it adapts to make each audience care.
