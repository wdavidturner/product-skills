## Pose Questions, Make Them Co-Adventurers

Strategic narrative works best when the prospect feels like they're discovering the journey with you, not being lectured at.

**Incorrect (telling):**

> "The shift from reactive to proactive success is happening. Winners are already there. You need to make this shift too.
>
> The object of the new game is to see churn before it happens.
>
> Here are the obstacles you face. Here's how we solve them."

This is all declarative. The prospect is a passive recipient of your presentation.

**Correct (inviting):**

> "We see something happening in customer success. Companies are shifting from reactive to proactive — seeing problems before they hit.
>
> Are you seeing this too? [Pause for response]
>
> We asked ourselves a simple question: What would it take to see churn before it happens?
>
> That's become our north star. Let me show you what we've learned about the obstacles..."

The shift from "this is what you need" to "are you seeing this?" and "we asked a question" makes the prospect a co-adventurer.

**Techniques:**
- "Am I crazy, or are you seeing this shift too?"
- "We asked a simple question: what would it take to [object]?"
- "Here's what we've learned about the obstacles..."
- "What's your experience with [obstacle]?"

**Test your narrative:** Can you tell it conversationally, or does it only work as a monologue? If the prospect can't participate, you're telling, not inviting.

**Why it matters:**

When prospects are co-adventurers, they internalize the story. They become advocates who can retell it. When they're passive listeners, they forget it as soon as you leave.
