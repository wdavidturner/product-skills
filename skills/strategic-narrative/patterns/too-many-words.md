## Old Game / New Game Should Be 2-4 Words Each

The power of the shift comes from its simplicity. If you need a paragraph to explain the old game and new game, you haven't found your shift yet.

**Incorrect (too many words):**

> **Old Game:** "Traditional enterprise software deployment models where companies purchase perpetual licenses and maintain the software on their own infrastructure, requiring significant IT resources and capital expenditure"
>
> **New Game:** "Modern cloud-based software delivery approaches that enable companies to subscribe to software as a service, allowing for faster deployment, automatic updates, and operational expenditure models"

By the time you finish explaining, the energy is gone.

**Correct (2-4 words each):**

> **Old Game → New Game:**
> - "Software → Cloud" (Salesforce)
> - "Transactions → Subscriptions" (Zuora)
> - "Opinions → Reality" (Gong)
> - "Reactive → Proactive" (Customer success narrative)
> - "Later → Now" (Drift)

These are punchy, memorable, and immediately understood.

**Finding the words:**
- What did customers call the old way of doing things?
- What do winners call the new way?
- Can you say it in a breath?
- Would it work as a t-shirt?

**Yes, you lose completeness.** "Software → Cloud" doesn't capture all the nuance. That's okay. Someone might say "but I still buy some software" — and that's fine. The shift doesn't have to be universal to be powerful.

**Why it matters:**

Concise naming makes the shift repeatable. If your sales team can't remember and retell the shift, it won't spread through your organization or your customers' organizations.
