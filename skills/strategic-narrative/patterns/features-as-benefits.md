## Features Are Magic Gifts, Not Benefits Lists

In strategic narrative, features aren't "benefits" — they're the magic gifts that help the hero overcome obstacles and win the new game.

**Incorrect (features as benefits list):**

> "Why choose us:
> - AI-powered predictions with 95% accuracy
> - Automated workflows save 10 hours/week
> - Real-time dashboards for visibility
> - Enterprise-grade security"

This is the arrogant doctor approach: "Here's why my treatment is best." It invites comparison. "Does competitor X also have AI predictions?"

**Correct (features as magic gifts):**

> "You want to see churn before it happens. Here are the obstacles in your way:
>
> **Obstacle 1:** 'I can't see which accounts are at risk until they're already churning.'
> → **Magic gift:** Our AI analyzes 200+ signals and flags at-risk accounts 90 days out.
>
> **Obstacle 2:** 'Even when I know, I don't have time to act on every account.'
> → **Magic gift:** Automated playbooks trigger interventions without manual work.
>
> **Obstacle 3:** 'I can't prove the value of CS to leadership.'
> → **Magic gift:** Real-time dashboards show exactly how interventions drive retention."

Each feature becomes a weapon against a specific obstacle, not just a capability floating in space.

**Think of Lord of the Rings:** Frodo doesn't get a "benefits list" — he gets the Ring (to complete the quest), the Elven cloak (to hide from enemies), and Sting (to fight in the dark). Each gift solves a specific challenge on the journey.

**Why it matters:**

Features without context invite "so what?" Features framed as obstacle-destroyers show exactly why they matter for winning the new game.
