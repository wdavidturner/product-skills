## You Can't Position in a Conference Room

Positioning must be grounded in customer reality. Teams that develop positioning without customer input will be wrong — usually about what actually differentiates them and who cares most.

**Incorrect (conference room positioning):**

> **Leadership offsite:**
> "Let's spend the afternoon figuring out our positioning. We all know our product well."
>
> **CEO:** "Our AI is clearly the differentiator."
> **VP Product:** "I think it's the integrations."
> **VP Marketing:** "Customers love how easy it is to use."
>
> **Result:** The most senior person wins the argument. The positioning sounds good internally but doesn't resonate with customers because it's based on what the team *thinks* matters, not what actually wins deals.

**Correct (evidence-based positioning):**

> **Before the workshop:**
> - Sales provides: "Here's what we compete against, what objections we hear, and why we win/lose deals"
> - Customer Success provides: "Here's why customers say they stay, and why they churn"
> - Win/loss interviews: "Here's what customers said tipped their decision"
>
> **During the workshop:**
> "Sales, when you win a deal against the spreadsheet, what capability do they cite?"
> "When we lose to Competitor X, what are they claiming?"
> "Customer Success, why do our happiest customers say they love us?"
>
> **Result:** Positioning grounded in evidence. The AI isn't the differentiator — it's the specific workflow that saves ops managers 5 hours weekly. That's what wins deals.

**Why it matters:**

You can't hypothesize your way to positioning. The only source of truth is what actually happens in the market — what you compete against, what wins, and why customers stay.
