## Competitive Alternatives Include Status Quo

When asked "who are your competitors?" most teams list products in their category. But competitive alternatives are what customers would actually *do* if you didn't exist — including manual processes, spreadsheets, and doing nothing.

**Incorrect (listing category competitors):**

> **Competitive Analysis for Customer Success Platform:**
> - Gainsight
> - ChurnZero
> - Totango
> - Planhat
>
> **Strategy:** Differentiate on features vs. these players.

**Correct (capturing all alternatives):**

> **What customers actually do instead:**
> - **Status quo:** CSM team uses spreadsheets to track health scores, manually checks usage data in multiple systems
> - **"Good enough" solutions:** Basic CRM with custom fields, Slack channels per customer
> - **Headcount alternative:** Hire another CSM to handle the workload manually
> - **Doing nothing:** Hope churn doesn't get worse while focusing on new sales
> - **Shortlist:** Gainsight and ChurnZero for enterprise; basic tools for SMB
>
> **Strategy:** Our real competition for mid-market isn't Gainsight — it's "CSMs copying data into spreadsheets every Monday." Position against that pain first.

**Why it matters:**

In B2B, ~40% of deals are lost to "no decision" — the customer stuck with status quo. If your positioning only addresses how you beat Gainsight, you'll lose all those deals to spreadsheets. Position against what you actually have to beat.
