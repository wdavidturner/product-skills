## Focus Positioning on the Champion, Arm Them for Others

In B2B, 5-7 people influence a purchase decision. Many teams create positioning for all these personas. This is a mistake — your positioning must crush it with the champion. Others can't make the deal happen, but they can kill it.

**Incorrect (equal-weight personas):**

> **Persona positioning:**
> - Eric, IT Manager: Values security and integrations
> - Janet, End User: Values ease of use
> - Mike, CFO: Values ROI and cost
> - Sarah, CS Leader (Champion): Values efficiency and outcomes
>
> **Marketing creates:** Separate messaging for each persona. Sales pitch tries to address all four. Website has four different value props sections.
>
> **Result:** Messaging is diluted. Pitch is unfocused. The champion (Sarah) doesn't feel like this was built for her.

**Correct (champion-first positioning):**

> **The reality of B2B deals:**
>
> 1. Sarah (champion) is tasked with finding a solution
> 2. Sarah does research, makes shortlist, takes first calls
> 3. If Sarah doesn't see value → you never meet anyone else
> 4. If Sarah's convinced → she sells Eric, Janet, and Mike internally
>
> **Positioning priority:**
> - **Primary:** Crush it with Sarah. Every word of positioning should resonate with her.
> - **Secondary:** Arm Sarah to handle objections from Eric (IT), Janet (users), Mike (finance)
>
> **Sales approach:**
> "Sarah, when you take this to IT, they're going to ask about security. Here's our SOC 2 cert and how we handle data. Want me to put together a one-pager you can share?"
>
> "When Janet's team evaluates this, they might worry about learning curve. Here's our training program — we can reference customers who ramped in 2 weeks."
>
> **Result:** Sarah feels supported. She has answers for everyone. Deal moves forward.

**Why it matters:**

You win or lose with the champion. If your positioning resonates with the CFO but not the champion, you never get to pitch the CFO. Focus positioning on the champion, then arm them to handle everyone else.
