## "Everyone" Is Not a Target Customer

Target customers aren't everyone who *could* use your product. They're the accounts that care most about your differentiated value — where you win consistently and retain reliably.

**Incorrect (broad targeting):**

> **Target customer definition:**
> "Any B2B company that needs to manage customer relationships."
>
> **Or slightly better but still wrong:**
> "SMB and mid-market companies in technology, healthcare, financial services, retail, and manufacturing."
>
> **Result:** Marketing campaigns are generic. Sales chases any lead that moves. Win rates are low because positioning doesn't resonate with any specific buyer's problems.

**Correct (tight targeting based on value fit):**

> **Who cares most about our differentiated value?**
>
> Our value: "Prove customer success ROI by connecting CS activities to revenue outcomes"
>
> **Target account characteristics:**
> - B2B SaaS with ARR $5M-$50M
> - Customer Success team of 3-10 people (big enough to need tools, small enough to feel pain)
> - Already using a CRM (Salesforce or HubSpot)
> - High customer concentration (losing one customer hurts)
> - CS reports to a VP or CRO who must justify headcount
>
> **Result:** Marketing speaks directly to CS leaders at growth-stage SaaS. Sales qualifies on these criteria. Win rates double for accounts that match.

**Why it matters:**

Your differentiated value means different things to different buyers. "Prove CS ROI" is life-or-death for a CS leader justifying headcount; it's irrelevant to an enterprise with unlimited budget. Targeting lets you go deep where you win.
