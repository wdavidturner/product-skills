## Don't Start with Market Category

Most teams start positioning by deciding what market category they're in. This is backwards — you can't judge if a category is right until you know your differentiated value and target customers.

**Incorrect (starting with category):**

> **Team meeting:**
> "We're a CRM. Now let's figure out how we're different from Salesforce and HubSpot."
>
> **Result:** The team spends weeks comparing features to CRM competitors, ends up with a list of minor differentiators like "easier to use" and "better support" that any competitor could claim.

**Correct (starting with competitive alternatives):**

> **Team meeting:**
> "What do our customers use instead of us? Let's talk to sales."
>
> **Sales input:** "Half our deals, we're replacing spreadsheets and the sales manager's memory. The other half, they're looking at Pipedrive and Close — not Salesforce."
>
> **Result:** The team realizes they're not competing with enterprise CRM at all. Their differentiated value is against small team chaos, not Salesforce features. The right category might be "sales pipeline for small teams" not "CRM."

**Why it matters:**

Market category is the *last* decision, not the first. It should be chosen to make your differentiated value obvious to your target customers. If you start with category, you'll force-fit your positioning into assumptions that may not reflect reality.
