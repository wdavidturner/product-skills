## 40-60% of Deals Die to Indecision, Not Competitors

Most teams obsess over competitors while ignoring their biggest enemy: the customer who can't decide. Research shows 40-60% of B2B deals end in "no decision" — not because status quo was better, but because the buyer couldn't make a confident choice.

**Incorrect (competitor-focused positioning):**

> **Sales pitch focus:**
> "Let me show you why we're better than Zendesk. We have more features, better pricing, and superior support."
>
> **Result:** Prospect thinks, "Okay, but I'm also looking at Freshdesk, Intercom, and just keeping our shared inbox. I'm overwhelmed. Let me tell my boss now isn't the right time."
>
> **Lost to:** "No decision" — not Zendesk.

**Correct (help the buyer decide):**

> **Sales pitch approach:**
> "Let me paint the picture of your options. There are basically three approaches to this problem:
>
> 1. **Shared inbox** — Great because it's simple. But as you grow, you can't track, prioritize, or report.
>
> 2. **Help desk software** (Zendesk, etc.) — Full-featured, handles scale. But it was built to reduce support costs, not delight customers. It assigns ticket numbers, pushes to self-service.
>
> 3. **Customer service for digital businesses** (us) — Easy like inbox, features you won't outgrow, built to make service a growth driver.
>
> Can we agree that for a company like yours, option 3 makes the most sense?"
>
> **Result:** Prospect feels confident. They can explain this framework to their boss. Decision happens.

**Why it matters:**

Your positioning isn't just about why you beat competitors — it's about helping overwhelmed buyers make confident decisions. Teach them how to think about the market. If they can't justify their choice, they'll choose "do nothing."
