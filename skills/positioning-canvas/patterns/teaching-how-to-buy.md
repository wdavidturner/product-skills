## Teach Buyers How to Buy

Most B2B buyers have never purchased your category before. They're overwhelmed by options and afraid of making a bad choice. Instead of just pitching your product, help them understand the market and make a confident decision.

**Incorrect (pitch-focused selling):**

> **Buyer context:** First time buying customer success software. Boss said "figure it out." They've looked at G2 Crowd — there are 50 options in the "top right" quadrant.
>
> **Sales rep approach:**
> "Let me tell you about our product. We have the best AI, the best integrations, the best support team..."
>
> **Buyer internal monologue:** "Okay, but the last three vendors said the same thing. I still don't know how to choose. What if I pick wrong and look stupid?"
>
> **Result:** Buyer tells boss "now's not the right time" because making no decision is safer than making a wrong one.

**Correct (teach-focused selling):**

> **Sales rep approach:**
> "You're looking at a lot of options, so let me give you a framework. In this market, there are basically three approaches:
>
> 1. **Point solutions** — Health scoring tools, NPS tools. Each does one thing well. You'll need 4-5 of them, and they won't talk to each other.
>
> 2. **Enterprise platforms** (Gainsight) — Does everything. But it's built for 50+ person CS teams with dedicated ops. Implementation is 6 months.
>
> 3. **Growth-stage solutions** (us) — Core capabilities for a 5-15 person team. Stands up in weeks, not months. Grows with you.
>
> For a company your size, you're probably looking at option 2 or 3. If you're planning to hire 50 CSMs this year, go with Gainsight. If you need something that works now and scales as you grow, that's us.
>
> What questions would help you decide?"
>
> **Result:** Buyer has a mental framework. They can explain their choice to their boss. Decision happens.

**Why it matters:**

Confused buyers don't buy. They delay. Your job isn't just to pitch — it's to help the champion feel confident explaining their recommendation. Give them the language and framework.
