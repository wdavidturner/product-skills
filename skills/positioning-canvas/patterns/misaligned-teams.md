## Positioning Requires Cross-Functional Alignment

The most common cause of weak positioning isn't bad strategy — it's misalignment. When sales, marketing, product, and leadership each tell slightly different stories, the market receives a blurry message.

**Incorrect (siloed positioning):**

> **What each team believes:**
>
> **Founder:** "We're the only enterprise-grade solution in the market. We compete with Salesforce."
>
> **VP Sales:** "We mostly sell to mid-market. We replace spreadsheets and beat Pipedrive on ease of use."
>
> **Marketing:** "Our website says we're the modern CRM for growing teams."
>
> **Product:** "Our technical differentiator is the real-time sync engine."
>
> **Result:** Prospects get confused. The website promises one thing, sales demos emphasize another, and the product experience is different still.

**Correct (aligned through shared process):**

> **Positioning workshop includes:**
> - CEO / Founder
> - Head of Sales (knows what wins deals)
> - Head of Marketing (will translate to messaging)
> - Head of Product (knows differentiation deeply)
> - Customer Success (knows why customers stay)
>
> **The process:**
> 1. Sales shares deal reality: who they beat, why they win, why they lose
> 2. Product shares technical differentiation
> 3. CS shares retention drivers
> 4. Team debates and aligns on each component
> 5. Everyone signs off before leaving the room
>
> **Result:** One story. Sales pitches it. Marketing messages it. Product builds to it. CS reinforces it.

**Why it matters:**

Misalignment isn't just confusing for customers — it creates internal friction. Sales ignores marketing materials. Product builds features that don't support positioning. The company fights itself instead of the competition.
