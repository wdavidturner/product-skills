## Dominate a Beachhead Before Expanding

Bowling pin strategy: Win a narrow segment completely, then use that position to expand into adjacent segments. Trying to win a broad market immediately dilutes your positioning and spreads resources thin.

**Incorrect (broad market positioning from day one):**

> **Startup pitch:**
> "We're CRM for enterprises. Our TAM is $50B. We'll compete with Salesforce across all verticals."
>
> **Reality:** You have 15 employees and $5M in funding. Salesforce has 70,000 employees.
>
> **Result:** Positioning is generic to appeal to everyone. Marketing spend is scattered. Sales chases any lead. You win occasional deals but can't build a defensible position anywhere.

**Correct (bowling pin strategy):**

> **The approach:**
>
> ```
>        [Lead pin: Investment Bank CRM]
>                 ↓
>     [Retail Banking] [Asset Management]
>                 ↓
>        [Financial Services CRM]
>                 ↓
>          [Insurance] [Wealth]
>                 ↓
>           [Enterprise CRM]
> ```
>
> **Stage 1 positioning:** "CRM for investment banks. Built for relationship-driven sales with long deal cycles and compliance requirements."
>
> **Why it works:**
> - Investment banks have specific needs that Salesforce doesn't address well
> - When you win 10 of 20 major investment banks, you own that segment
> - Reference customers make adjacent segments (retail banking) easier
> - Each pin knocked over gives momentum for the next
>
> **Salesforce story:** Started as "CRM for small businesses" — not enterprise. Dominated that segment. Expanded up-market over time.

**Why it matters:**

Positioning is about focus. A narrow positioning that dominates beats a broad positioning that's "considered" but never chosen. Own a beachhead before expanding.
