## Product Demos Should Prove Value, Not Expose Features

Most sales demos are feature expositions: click through every menu, show every capability. This overwhelms buyers and fails to answer the real question: "Why should I pick you?"

**Incorrect (feature dump demo):**

> **Sales rep:**
> "Let me show you everything the product can do."
>
> *Clicks through inbox view*
> "Here's the inbox. You can see all your conversations here."
>
> *Clicks through settings*
> "Here's where you configure automations. You can do rules, triggers, assignments..."
>
> *Clicks through reports*
> "Here's our reporting. You can build custom reports, export to CSV..."
>
> *30 minutes later*
>
> **Prospect:** "Okay... so how is this different from Zendesk?"
>
> **Result:** Prospect is overwhelmed with features but can't articulate why this is better than alternatives.

**Correct (value-structured demo):**

> **After the setup (insight, alternatives, perfect world):**
>
> **Sales rep:**
> "We agreed you want something easy like an inbox, that you won't outgrow, and that's built to deliver amazing service. Let me show you how we deliver each of those."
>
> **Value 1 — Easy like an inbox:**
> "Look at the interface. It's a shared inbox. Your team doesn't have to learn a new system. Here's how an agent would handle a customer..." *Shows specific workflow*
>
> **Value 2 — Won't outgrow:**
> "Now, as you scale, you need features. Here's how you'd do prioritization, assignment rules, automation..." *Shows just enough to prove capability*
>
> **Value 3 — Built for amazing service:**
> "Notice the customer stays 'Dave,' not ticket #1479. They choose their channel. Here's how that looks on their end..." *Shows customer experience*
>
> **Result:** Prospect can articulate: "Easy to use, scalable, built for service." They can explain this to their boss.

**Why it matters:**

Buyers don't remember 30 features. They remember 2-3 reasons to choose you. Structure demos around value themes, not product menus.
