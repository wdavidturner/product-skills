## If Competitors Can Claim It, It's Not Differentiated

Many positioning statements include value props that any competitor could claim. "Easy to use," "saves time," "great support" — these aren't differentiated value. They're table stakes that everyone says.

**Incorrect (generic value claims):**

> **Our Value Proposition:**
> - Easy to use interface
> - Save hours every week
> - World-class customer support
> - Integrates with your existing tools
> - Secure and reliable
>
> **The test:** Could Competitor X put this on their website? Yes. Could Competitor Y? Yes.
>
> **Result:** Customers see identical messaging from everyone. There's no reason to pick you over alternatives.

**Correct (differentiated value):**

> **Value we can claim that alternatives cannot:**
>
> | Generic Claim | Differentiated Version |
> |--------------|----------------------|
> | "Easy to use" | "The only solution that works inside Salesforce — no new system to learn" |
> | "Saves time" | "Automates the Monday report that takes your CS team 4 hours to build manually" |
> | "Great support" | "Includes dedicated implementation team for first 90 days — competitors charge $15K extra" |
> | "Integrates" | "Two-way sync with Slack means updates happen where your team already works" |
>
> **The test:** Can competitors claim "works inside Salesforce"? Only if they're built on Salesforce. That's differentiated.

**Why it matters:**

If a prospect puts your pitch deck and a competitor's side by side and can't tell them apart, you haven't done positioning. Differentiated value is what gives customers a reason to choose — and justify that choice to their boss.
