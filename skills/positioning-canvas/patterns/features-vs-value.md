## Capabilities Aren't Value — Translate the "So What?"

A capability is something you have. Value is what it enables for customers. Many teams stop at listing features and never translate to why customers should care.

**Incorrect (listing capabilities):**

> **Our Differentiators:**
> - Built on Salesforce platform
> - AI-powered recommendations
> - Real-time sync with CRM
> - Custom workflow builder
> - Native mobile app

This is a feature list. A customer reads this and thinks, "So what? Why do I care?"

**Correct (translating to value):**

> **Capability:** Built on Salesforce platform
>
> **So what?** Sales enablement data lives with sales data
>
> **So what?** Can track which content reps use and correlate to deals won
>
> **So what?** Can measure if enablement activities actually improve time to first deal
>
> **Differentiated Value:** "Prove sales enablement ROI with actual revenue metrics — something you can't do with standalone tools."

**The value ladder for each capability:**

| Capability | So What? | So What? | Differentiated Value |
|-----------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Built on Salesforce | Data integration | Measure impact on deals | Prove enablement ROI |
| AI recommendations | Suggests next content | Reps find answers faster | Reduce ramp time by 40% |
| Real-time sync | Always current | No manual updates | CSMs never work from stale data |

**Why it matters:**

Customers don't buy features. They buy outcomes. If you can't articulate the "so what?" for each capability, you're leaving it to the customer to figure out — and they usually won't.
