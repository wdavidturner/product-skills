## You Can't Do JTBD in a Conference Room

Hypothesizing jobs without talking to customers will be wrong. Always. The value of JTBD is uncovering the *irrational, contextual* reasons people buy — things you can't guess from inside your building.

**Incorrect (conference room JTBD):**

> **Team Workshop Output:**
>
> "Based on our experience and market research, we believe our customers' jobs to be done are:
> 1. Save time on repetitive tasks
> 2. Collaborate better with their team
> 3. Get visibility into project status
>
> Let's build features for these jobs!"
>
> *Result:* You built for jobs you imagined, not jobs that exist. Customers say "nice features" and don't buy.

**Correct (research-based JTBD):**

> **Post-Interview Findings:**
>
> "We interviewed 12 recent customers. None mentioned 'saving time' or 'collaboration' as why they bought.
>
> The top job: 'I just got promoted and inherited a mess. I need to look like I've got it under control fast — before anyone notices I don't.'
>
> Second job: 'We lost a client because things fell through the cracks. My boss said fix it or else.'
>
> These are anxious, emotional, urgent jobs — not the rational 'efficiency' jobs we assumed."

**Why it matters:**

Your team knows your product. Your team does not know your customers' lives. The jobs that drive purchases are often surprising, emotional, and context-specific. "Why would someone cut off their arm?" sounds crazy until you learn they're trapped under a boulder. The irrational is where the insight lives.
