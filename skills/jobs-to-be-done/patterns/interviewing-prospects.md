## Only Interview People Who Already Switched

Interviewing people who "might buy" or "are considering" your product tells you nothing reliable. People cannot predict their future behavior. Only interview people who already made a decision and took action.

**Incorrect (interviewing prospects):**

> "We interviewed 20 people in our target market about what they'd want in a project management tool."
>
> Findings: "They said they want AI features, Gantt charts, and a mobile app."

These are wishes, not jobs. When it's time to actually buy, they'll make a completely different decision based on what's happening in their life at that moment.

**Correct (interviewing recent switchers):**

> "We interviewed 12 customers who signed up in the last 3-6 months, are actively using the product, and are happily paying."
>
> Findings: "They switched because they lost a major deliverable in email threads. None of them mentioned AI. Most didn't even know we had Gantt charts. They bought because we showed their whole project on one screen."

**Why it matters:**

"Bitching ain't switching." Just because someone complains about their current tool doesn't mean they'll change. Just because they say they want a feature doesn't mean they'll buy it. The only reliable signal is past behavior. Interview people who already switched — in the last 3-6 months, so they remember what drove the decision.
