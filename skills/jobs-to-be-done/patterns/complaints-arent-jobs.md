## Complaints Don't Predict Action

"Bitching ain't switching." Just because customers complain about something doesn't mean they'll take action to change it. Complaints are cheap. Switching has real costs.

**Incorrect (treating complaints as demand):**

> **Customer Feedback Analysis:**
> - 47 complaints about slow load times
> - 32 complaints about missing dark mode
> - 28 complaints about mobile app
>
> **Product Decision:** Prioritize performance, then dark mode, then mobile.
>
> *Six months later:* "We fixed all the things they complained about but churn didn't change and signups didn't increase. What happened?"

**Correct (studying actual switching behavior):**

> **Churn Interview Findings:**
> - 8 of 12 churned customers left because their team couldn't get adoption (habit of old tool was too strong)
> - 3 left because a new leader came in with a preferred tool
> - 1 left due to performance issues
>
> **Signup Interview Findings:**
> - None mentioned performance, dark mode, or mobile
> - Most mentioned "could finally see everything in one place"
>
> **Product Decision:** Focus on reducing team adoption friction, not the complained-about features.

**Why it matters:**

Complaints tell you what's annoying. Switching behavior tells you what's *intolerable*. People tolerate annoyances for years. They only switch when the push becomes unbearable or the pull becomes irresistible. Study switchers, not complainers.
