## Job Statements Need Context and Outcome

A job statement without context is useless. "Customers want to save time" applies to everyone and tells you nothing about what to build or how to position.

**Incorrect (outcome only):**

> "Users want to save time on reporting."

> "Customers want to collaborate better."

> "People want to feel organized."

These could describe any product. They don't help you prioritize features or write messaging.

**Correct (context + motivation + outcome):**

> "When I'm **behind on my weekly stakeholder report** and it's already Thursday afternoon, help me **pull the key metrics together without hunting through five different tools**, so I can **look competent in front of leadership and leave work on time**."

> "When I've **just taken over a project mid-stream** and don't know what's been decided, help me **quickly see the history of decisions and who made them**, so I can **avoid re-litigating settled issues and looking like I don't know what's going on**."

**Why it matters:**

The context ("behind on my weekly report, Thursday afternoon") tells you WHEN this job activates. The motivation ("without hunting through five tools") tells you WHAT to build. The outcome ("look competent, leave on time") tells you HOW to message it. Without all three, you're guessing.
