## Don't Ask Why — Ask What Happened

Asking "why did you buy this?" triggers post-hoc rationalization. Customers will give you logical-sounding reasons that have nothing to do with their actual decision.

**Incorrect (asking for reasons):**

> Interviewer: "Why did you decide to buy our project management tool?"
>
> Customer: "It had good reviews and the price was reasonable."

This tells you nothing useful. They're giving you surface-level rationalizations.

**Correct (asking for the story):**

> Interviewer: "Take me back to when you first started thinking about finding a new tool. What was going on?"
>
> Customer: "Well, we'd just lost a client because we missed a deadline. My boss was furious. That night I was lying in bed thinking 'this can't happen again.' The next morning I started Googling..."

Now you're getting the real push (lost client, boss furious, anxiety at night), the emotional energy (fear, embarrassment), and the timeline of events.

**Why it matters:**

"Why" triggers the rational brain. "What happened" triggers memory and story. The story contains the job; the rationalization doesn't.
