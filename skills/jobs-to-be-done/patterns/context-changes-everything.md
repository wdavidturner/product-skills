## Same Person, Different Context, Different Job

The same person will "hire" completely different products for the same underlying need depending on their context. Context isn't a modifier — it's the primary driver of the job.

**Incorrect (persona-based thinking):**

> **Persona: Marketing Manager Mary**
> - Needs: Analytics, campaign tools, team collaboration
> - Pain points: Too many tools, data silos, reporting burden
> - Solution: Our all-in-one marketing platform

**Correct (context-based thinking):**

> **Marketing Manager Mary — Monday morning:**
> - Context: Behind on weekly report, leadership meeting in 2 hours
> - Job: "Help me pull together something credible fast"
> - Hires: The dashboard that loads fastest with pre-built views
> - Competition: Copying last week's report and changing dates
>
> **Marketing Manager Mary — Quarterly planning:**
> - Context: Building next quarter's strategy, needs to justify budget
> - Job: "Help me prove what worked and make a case for more resources"
> - Hires: Deep analytics, exportable charts, historical comparisons
> - Competition: Hiring an analyst, gut feel + optimism
>
> **Marketing Manager Mary — New campaign launch:**
> - Context: High visibility project, needs to look innovative
> - Job: "Help me do something impressive that makes me look good"
> - Hires: Flashy new features, things she can demo to leadership
> - Competition: Playing it safe with proven tactics

**Why it matters:**

Personas assume stable needs. But Mary on Monday morning is a completely different buyer than Mary in quarterly planning. If you build for "Marketing Manager Mary" generically, you build for no one. Build for Mary-in-a-specific-context.
