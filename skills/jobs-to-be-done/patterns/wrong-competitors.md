## Your Real Competitors Aren't Who You Think

Category competitors (other products in your space) are often not your real competition. The real competition is whatever the customer would do *instead* — including doing nothing, using Excel, or hiring an intern.

**Incorrect (category competitors):**

> **Competitive Analysis for Project Management Tool:**
> - Asana
> - Monday.com
> - Jira
> - ClickUp
>
> **Strategy:** Beat them on features and price.

**Correct (actual alternatives):**

> **What customers actually do instead:**
> - Spreadsheets and email ("good enough")
> - Sticky notes and whiteboards (for small teams)
> - Hiring a project coordinator (for larger teams)
> - Doing nothing and hoping it works out
> - The PM just staying late to keep track manually
>
> **Strategy:** Our real competition for small teams isn't Asana — it's "Sarah just keeps it all in her head and works weekends." We need to show why that's unsustainable, not why we're better than Monday.com.

**Why it matters:**

If you compete against Asana, you fight over features. If you compete against "Sarah working weekends," you fight for a completely different job — and often have no competition at all. The job defines the competitive set, not the product category.
