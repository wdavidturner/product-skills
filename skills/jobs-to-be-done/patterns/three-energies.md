## Address Functional, Emotional, and Social Energy

Every job has three dimensions: Functional (get something done), Emotional (how I feel about myself), and Social (how others perceive me). Products that only solve the functional job often lose to products that address all three.

**Incorrect (functional only):**

> **Product Positioning:**
> "Our project management tool saves teams 5 hours per week with automated status updates and smart task assignment."
>
> *Result:* Customers say "interesting" and don't buy. The ones who do buy churn when a shinier tool appears.

**Correct (all three energies):**

> **Functional energy:**
> "Saves 5 hours per week on status updates."
>
> **Emotional energy:**
> "Stop feeling anxious on Sunday nights about what you're forgetting. Stop feeling like you're drowning and barely keeping up."
>
> **Social energy:**
> "Walk into Monday standups actually knowing what's going on. Look like the PM who has their shit together. Stop being the bottleneck your team complains about."
>
> **Product Positioning:**
> "Finally feel in control of your projects — and look like it too."

**Why it matters:**

A tool that saves time (functional) but makes someone feel stupid (emotional) or look disorganized to their team (social) won't get hired. The emotional and social jobs are often the *real* reason people buy — the functional benefit is just the justification they give their boss.
