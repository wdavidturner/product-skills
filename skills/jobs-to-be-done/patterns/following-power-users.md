## Power Users Will Lead You Astray

Your most engaged users are not representative of the job that will scale your business. Following their requests often destroys what made your product valuable to new users.

**Incorrect (building for power users):**

> **Product Planning:**
>
> "Our most active users are requesting:
> - Custom scripting/automation
> - API access for integrations
> - Advanced permission hierarchies
> - Bulk editing tools
>
> These users love us and pay the most. Let's prioritize their requests!"
>
> *Result:* Product becomes complex. New users bounce. The job that got you here gets buried under power features.

**Correct (understanding jobs at each stage):**

> **Job Analysis:**
>
> **Job that acquires customers:**
> "I need to see my whole project on one screen without setup."
> → Requires: Simplicity, immediate value, no configuration
>
> **Job that retains power users:**
> "I've built my workflow around this tool and need it to scale with me."
> → Requires: Customization, automation, advanced features
>
> **Decision:**
> "These are different jobs. We can't sacrifice the acquisition job for the retention job. Power features go in a 'Pro' tier or progressive disclosure — never on the main path."

**Why it matters:**

The job that gets customers in the door is often different from the job that keeps power users engaged. If you let power users drive the roadmap, you optimize for retention at the cost of acquisition. Most companies die from acquisition failure, not from power users leaving.
