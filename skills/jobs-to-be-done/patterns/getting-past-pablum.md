## Push Past the First Answer

First answers in interviews are "pablum" — generic, safe, surface-level responses. The real insight is 2-3 questions deeper. Don't accept the first answer; push for the story behind it.

**Incorrect (accepting surface answers):**

> Interviewer: "What made you choose our product?"
>
> Customer: "It seemed easy to use and had good reviews."
>
> Interviewer: "Great, thanks. Next question..."
>
> *Result:* You learn nothing. "Easy to use" and "good reviews" are non-answers that could apply to any product.

**Correct (pushing deeper):**

> Interviewer: "What made you choose our product?"
>
> Customer: "It seemed easy to use and had good reviews."
>
> Interviewer: "Tell me more about 'easy to use' — what were you worried wouldn't be easy?"
>
> Customer: "Well, our last tool was a nightmare to set up. IT had to be involved, it took weeks..."
>
> Interviewer: "What happened with that tool that made setup such a big deal?"
>
> Customer: "Honestly, I'd been burned before. I recommended a tool once that took forever to implement and my boss was not happy. I couldn't let that happen again."
>
> *Now you have the real job:* "Help me look good to my boss by not recommending something that becomes a nightmare."

**Techniques for pushing past pablum:**

1. **"Tell me more about that..."** — Always a good follow-up
2. **"What do you mean by [vague word]?"** — Make them define "easy" or "better"
3. **"Walk me through what happened..."** — Shift from opinions to story
4. **Play it back wrong:** "So you bought it because of the price?" (when you know it wasn't) — They'll correct you with the real reason

**Why it matters:**

The pablum layer protects the real answer. Customers give generic responses because they're safe and require no vulnerability. The job is hiding underneath. Your job as interviewer is to make it safe to go deeper.
