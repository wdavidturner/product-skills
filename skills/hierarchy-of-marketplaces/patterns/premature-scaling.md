## Don't Scale Before You've Tipped Your First Market

Expansion before tipping means spreading an unproven model across more places to fail. You need one market where the flywheel is actually spinning before you have a playbook to replicate.

**Incorrect (premature scaling):**

> **Founder pitch:**
> "We launched in Austin 6 months ago and we're at $200K GMV. We're now live in Denver, Phoenix, and Portland - each doing about $50K GMV. We're raising to launch in 10 more cities by year end."
>
> **Investor question:** "What's retention like in Austin?"
>
> "We're still figuring that out. But we need to move fast - competitors are eyeing our space."
>
> **What happens next:**
> - Each city requires its own go-to-market spend
> - No city reaches saturation
> - Competitor focuses everything on Austin, tips it, expands from strength
> - Startup runs out of runway spread across 14 cities at 10% saturation each

**Correct (tip before expanding):**

> **Founder approach:**
> "We launched in Austin 6 months ago. We're at $200K GMV, but more importantly:
> - We've saturated the downtown restaurant segment (73% of target restaurants)
> - Suppliers are now referring us to their restaurant customers
> - Buyer cohorts are improving month over month
> - We're seeing organic growth for the first time
>
> Austin is starting to tip. We're not expanding until we've proven the playbook and have contribution profit to reinvest. We'll likely launch in San Antonio in Q2 - similar market, same supply base."

**Why it matters:**

A competitor who puts $1M into one city will beat you if you spread $1M across ten. Worse, you won't have learned what actually works. Every expansion is an experiment; you need the control case (your tipped market) to know if new markets are succeeding.
