## Don't Chase GMV - Chase Happy GMV

Raw GMV is a vanity metric. Transactions without retention are building on sand. The marketplace that makes both sides genuinely happy will outlast the one with higher volume but lower satisfaction.

**Incorrect (chasing GMV):**

> **CEO update to board:**
> "We hit $1M annualized GMV this month! We're in 12 cities across 3 categories. Growth is accelerating - up 40% month over month."
>
> **What the data doesn't show:**
> - Buyer retention after first purchase: 15%
> - Seller churn rate: 8% monthly
> - Support tickets per transaction: 2.3
> - NPS from recent buyers: 12

The board sees hockey-stick growth. But the marketplace is a leaky bucket - every dollar of GMV costs more to replace because neither side is happy.

**Correct (measuring Happy GMV):**

> **CEO update to board:**
> "We're at $400K annualized GMV, concentrated in Boston restaurants. Our key metrics:
> - Buyer retention at 90 days: 62%
> - Seller retention at 90 days: 78%
> - Repeat order rate: 3.2x in first 60 days
> - Sean Ellis test: 47% would be 'very disappointed' if we disappeared
>
> We're not expanding until these cohorts stabilize. We believe we're 2-3 months from being ready to test Cambridge."

Lower GMV, but the flywheel is starting to work. Each dollar of GMV compounds because both sides want to stay.

**Why it matters:**

$1M GMV spread thin across many markets is worth less than $400K GMV in a market that's starting to tip. The former requires constant investment to maintain; the latter generates organic growth. Chasing GMV milestones creates incentives to spread thin when concentration is what builds defensibility.
