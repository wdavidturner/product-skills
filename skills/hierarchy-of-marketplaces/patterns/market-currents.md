## Ride Market Currents, Don't Try to Warm the Ocean

The best marketplace opportunities have tailwinds - something changing in the market that creates momentum. Without a current, you're trying to move water that doesn't want to move. With one, even a simple product gets pulled forward.

**Incorrect (fighting still water):**

> **Marketplace pitch (2015):**
> "We're building a marketplace for buying and selling used enterprise software licenses. Companies have excess licenses, others could use them cheaper."
>
> **Why it's still water:**
> - No regulatory change driving behavior
> - Enterprise buyers aren't actively seeking alternatives
> - Software vendors actively blocking secondary markets
> - No technology shift enabling new behavior
>
> **Result:** A decade of pushing. The market exists but there's no current pulling the company forward.

**Correct (riding a current):**

> **Airbnb's current (2009):**
> - Recession → people need extra income, willing to rent spare rooms
> - Recession → travelers looking for cheaper alternatives to hotels
> - Smartphones → photos and booking become frictionless
> - Social networks → trust through profiles becomes possible
>
> Multiple currents converged. A simple product got pulled forward by market forces.

> **Hipcamp's current (2015+):**
> - Urban density → people craving nature and escape
> - Instagram → glamping and outdoor experiences becoming aspirational
> - Airbnb normalized → staying on private property feels normal
> - RV/van life movement → more people seeking outdoor accommodations
>
> The market was already moving in Hipcamp's direction.

**Questions to identify currents:**

| Question | Strong current | Weak/no current |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Why now? | Regulatory change, tech shift, cultural movement | "It's always been possible" |
| Who's already moving? | Buyers/sellers actively seeking solutions | Market is static |
| What's forcing change? | Economic pressure, generational shift | Nothing requiring action |
| What's newly possible? | New technology enables new behavior | Could have been built 10 years ago |

**Why it matters:**

Building a marketplace is hard enough with tailwinds. Without them, you're spending capital and energy to create momentum that the market should provide. The best founders find where the water is already moving and put their raft in that stream.
