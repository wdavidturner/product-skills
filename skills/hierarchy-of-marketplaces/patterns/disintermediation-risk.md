## Long-Term Relationships Will Route Around You

Once buyer and seller know and trust each other, your marketplace becomes friction, not value. Either provide ongoing value or accept that mature relationships will leave.

**Incorrect (ignoring disintermediation):**

> **Home services marketplace strategy:**
> "We charge 15% of every transaction. Once customers find a great plumber, they'll keep using our platform because it's convenient."
>
> **Reality:**
> - Plumber: "Here's my card. Call me directly next time, I'll give you 10% off."
> - Customer: "Sure, why would I pay extra to go through an app?"
>
> **Founder's response:** "We'll add terms of service that prohibit off-platform transactions!"
>
> **Result:** Unenforceable. Customers and suppliers both resent the restriction. Best suppliers leave for competitors who don't try to lock them in.

**Correct (providing ongoing value):**

> **Home services marketplace strategy:**
>
> **For suppliers:**
> - Lead flow they can't replicate (marketing, SEO, brand)
> - Scheduling and dispatch tools
> - Payment processing and invoicing
> - Insurance and liability coverage
> - Reviews and reputation that follow them
>
> **For buyers:**
> - Quality guarantee (we'll send someone else if they don't show)
> - Vetting and background checks
> - Single payment method across all services
> - Service history and records
>
> "We know customers could call their plumber directly. We make staying on-platform more valuable than leaving through guarantees and convenience they can't get elsewhere."

Or acknowledge it and price accordingly:

> "Our value is in the first match. We charge a flat finder's fee, then a minimal ongoing rate for payment processing. We'd rather facilitate 100 ongoing relationships at 3% than watch 100 relationships leave at 15%."

**Why it matters:**

Disintermediation isn't disloyalty - it's rational behavior. If you're not providing value, you're just a tax on the relationship. Either build defensible ongoing value or acknowledge your role as a matchmaker and price for that reality.
