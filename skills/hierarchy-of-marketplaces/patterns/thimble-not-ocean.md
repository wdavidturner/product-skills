## Focus Like a Laser, Not Like Sunlight Warming an Ocean

Great marketplace founders focus their ambition like a laser beam on a small market. Poor founders spread their ambition like sunlight trying to warm an ocean. The thimble you can boil; the ocean you cannot.

**Incorrect (warming the ocean):**

> **Pitch from ambitious founder:**
> "We're building a marketplace for professional services - lawyers, accountants, consultants, designers, developers. We're live in LA, NYC, Chicago, Austin, and Miami. Any professional can sign up, any business can find help."
>
> **Metrics:**
> - 500 professionals across 5 categories
> - 200 businesses browsing
> - 15 completed transactions total
> - No city with more than 3 transactions in any category
>
> **Founder's justification:**
> "We need to prove the model works in different markets and categories. TAM is $200B!"

The sun is warm, but nothing is hot. No segment is concentrated enough to tip.

**Correct (boiling the thimble):**

> **Pitch from focused founder:**
> "We're building a marketplace for freelance graphic designers in Austin serving local restaurants and bars for menu design and branding."
>
> **Metrics:**
> - 45 designers (estimated 60% of Austin's relevant freelancers)
> - 120 restaurants (estimated 30% of downtown establishments)
> - 85 completed projects
> - 4 restaurants now requesting us for all design work
>
> **Founder's approach:**
> "It feels small, but we're close to owning this niche. Restaurants are starting to tell their designer friends about us. We're 2 months from testing bar menus, then wedding venues. Austin first, San Antonio next year."

The thimble is boiling. Adjacent thimbles can be heated from this one.

**Why it matters:**

You can't tip a market you haven't saturated. You can't saturate a market that's too big given your resources. The thimble feels uncomfortably small, but that's the point - you can reach a saturation point that triggers tipping. From there, the heat spreads.
