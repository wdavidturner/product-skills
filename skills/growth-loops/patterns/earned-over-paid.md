## Invest 80% in Earned Channels, Not Paid

Most growth teams invert the ratio. They spend 80% on paid acquisition and 20% on earned/owned channels. It should be the opposite.

**Incorrect (paid-heavy investment):**

> **Growth Team Budget Allocation:**
> - Facebook/Instagram Ads: 40%
> - Google Ads: 25%
> - LinkedIn Ads: 15%
> - Content/SEO: 10%
> - Viral/Referral: 5%
> - Other: 5%
>
> **Result:** When ad budgets get cut (recession, fundraising gap), growth stops. CAC keeps rising. No compounding effect.

**Correct (earned-heavy investment):**

> **Growth Team Budget Allocation:**
> - Content loops (SEO, templates, UGC): 35%
> - Viral loops (referral, sharing, collaboration): 25%
> - Product-led growth mechanics: 20%
> - Paid acquisition: 15%
> - Experimental channels: 5%
>
> **Paid's role:** Seed the earned channels. Boost content to get initial backlinks. Run ads to prove messaging before building organic.
>
> **Result:** Even if paid budget goes to zero, growth continues from compounding earned channels.

**Why it matters:**

Paid is a tax. Every dollar goes to Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn — and you have to pay it again next month. Earned channels (content that ranks, viral loops, word of mouth) compound over time. The content you create today still brings users in three years. The ad you ran today stops working the moment you stop paying.
