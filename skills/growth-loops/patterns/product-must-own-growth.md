## Product Must Own Growth — Not Just Marketing

In product-led companies, growth cannot be a marketing-only function. Product must own pipeline creation. This requires a fundamental org structure change.

**Incorrect (growth as marketing function):**

> **Org Structure:**
> - Marketing creates pipeline for sales
> - Sales closes deals
> - Product builds features, throws them over the fence
> - Growth team sits in marketing, runs ads and landing pages
>
> **Result:** Product builds features with no accountability for whether they drive acquisition. Marketing struggles to grow without product support. Sales complains about lead quality. Everyone points fingers.

**Correct (product owns growth):**

> **Org Structure for PLG:**
> - Product acquires and activates users
> - Product creates pipeline for sales (PQAs)
> - Marketing educates and finds enterprise buyers
> - Sales converts qualified accounts
>
> **Product goals include:**
> - Self-serve revenue targets (for growth PM)
> - PQA volume (product qualification → pipeline)
> - Free-to-paid conversion rate
>
> "We can't start product-led sales in marketing. Product has to take accountability over pipeline creation. Otherwise, failure mode within six months."

**Why it matters:**

Traditional B2B has let product off the hook for monetization. Product builds, sales sells. But in product-led companies, the product IS the distribution mechanism. If product doesn't own growth metrics, the whole model breaks. The collaboration must be product + sales, not marketing + sales.
