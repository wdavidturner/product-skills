## You Can't Outsource Finding Your Growth Model

Hiring a growth team before you understand your growth model is a recipe for failure. Founders must discover the first loops themselves.

**Incorrect (premature growth hire):**

> **Startup at $500K ARR:**
> - CEO: "We need to grow faster. Let's hire a Head of Growth."
> - Hires experienced growth leader from Airbnb
> - Growth leader asks: "What's our primary acquisition loop?"
> - CEO: "That's what we hired you to figure out."
>
> **Six months later:** Growth hire is frustrated. No clear loop exists. They're running random experiments with no volume. They quit.

**Correct (founder-led discovery):**

> **Startup at $500K ARR:**
> - Founder manually does sales calls, notices pattern: happy customers refer others
> - Founder builds simple referral program, tracks it in spreadsheet
> - Referral loop shows promise: 15% of customers refer within 60 days
> - Founder documents the loop, proves it works
> - At $2M ARR with clear loop: "Now we hire growth to scale this."

**Why it matters:**

Growth teams optimize and scale existing loops — they don't create them from nothing. The first wave of growth must be founder-led because only founders have the full context to recognize what's working. Hiring too early leads to expensive failure and blame in both directions.
