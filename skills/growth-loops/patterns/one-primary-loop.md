## One Loop Dominates — Others Supplement

Every successful company has one primary growth loop that drives the majority of their growth. Secondary loops supplement but never save you if the primary isn't working.

**Incorrect (spreading thin across loops):**

> **Growth Strategy:**
> - 25% effort on viral referral program
> - 25% effort on content/SEO
> - 25% effort on paid acquisition
> - 25% effort on sales-led outbound
>
> **Result:** Nothing works well. Each channel gets minimum viable effort. Growth is slow across all vectors. Team is exhausted.
>
> **Worse:** "We need to try more channels! Let's add influencer marketing, affiliate, events..."

**Correct (primary loop focus):**

> **Growth Strategy:**
> - 70% effort on content loop (our primary engine)
> - 15% effort on viral sharing (supplements content discovery)
> - 10% effort on paid (seeds content, tests messaging)
> - 5% effort on experimental channels
>
> **Why?**
> - Analysis showed content loop has best CAC and compounds
> - One strong loop beats three mediocre ones
> - Secondary loops amplify the primary, not replace it
>
> **Example:** Pinterest's primary loop was content (pins rank in Google). Viral sharing supplemented but wasn't the engine. They didn't spread thin.

**Why it matters:**

The temptation is to diversify risk by investing in multiple loops. But growth resources are limited. One excellent loop beats several mediocre ones. Find your primary loop, make it excellent, and let secondary loops amplify it.
