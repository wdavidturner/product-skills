## 75% of Freemium Users Don't Know What You're Selling

The biggest bottleneck in freemium conversion isn't your pricing or features — it's that most users have no idea what the paid product offers.

**Incorrect (focusing on pricing optimization):**

> **Conversion Rate Optimization Plan:**
> - Test $9 vs $12 vs $15 price points
> - Add annual discount options
> - Redesign pricing page layout
> - Test different feature matrices
>
> **Result:** 2% conversion rate doesn't move despite months of tests
>
> **The real problem:** Survey reveals 75% of free users can't name a single paid feature. They've never even looked at pricing.

**Correct (monetization awareness focus):**

> **Conversion Rate Optimization Plan:**
> - Goal: Every activated user sees 3+ paid feature touchpoints
> - Add "Pro feature" badges on locked capabilities
> - Show usage limits with "Upgrade to unlock"
> - Track: % of users who have viewed pricing page at least once
>
> **Example from SurveyMonkey:**
> - Added consistent "gold" UI color for all paid triggers
> - Ensured each user encountered at least 3 paid touchpoints
> - Result: Significant conversion rate improvement
>
> **Example from Slack:**
> - Show message limits approaching
> - Result: Major conversion rate increase from awareness alone

**Why it matters:**

Before optimizing what you're selling, make sure users know you're selling something. Monetization awareness is the 80/20 — it's often the single biggest lever for conversion, yet most teams skip to pricing page optimization.
