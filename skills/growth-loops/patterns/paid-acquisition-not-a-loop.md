## Paid Acquisition Is Not a Loop

Paid acquisition feels like growth, but it's buying users, not building an engine. The users you buy don't generate the next batch of users.

**Incorrect (treating paid as a growth loop):**

> **Growth Team Priorities:**
> 1. Scale Facebook ads — it's our "acquisition loop"
> 2. Optimize landing pages for conversion
> 3. A/B test ad creative
> 4. Increase budget 20% each quarter
>
> **Assumption:** If we get better at paid, growth will compound.
>
> **Reality 18 months later:** CAC has increased 3x. CPMs rose. Competitors bid up the same audiences. We're spending more to acquire fewer users.

**Correct (paid as supplement, not engine):**

> **Growth Team Priorities:**
> 1. Build content loop: User templates rank in Google → bring new users
> 2. Build viral loop: Sharing reports → collaborators sign up
> 3. Use paid to accelerate loops: Ads drive initial content, which ranks, which generates organic traffic forever
>
> **Paid's role:** Kindle the fire, don't BE the fire. Use paid to seed the loops, not replace them.

**Why it matters:**

Paid growth is a tax you pay to platforms. It doesn't compound — in fact, it often gets more expensive over time as competition increases. The ratio should be ~80% earned/owned (content, viral, product loops) and ~20% paid. Most struggling companies have this inverted.
