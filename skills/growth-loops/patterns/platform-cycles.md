## New Platforms Open, Then Close — Time Your Bets

Every major distribution platform follows a predictable cycle: competitive market → moat identification → platform opening → platform closing. You can't opt out — competitors will play even if you don't.

**Incorrect (ignoring platform cycles):**

> **2007: Facebook launches platform**
> - Company: "We don't build on other people's platforms. Too risky."
> - Competitors: Build social games on Facebook, grow massively
> - Zynga becomes a $10B company
>
> **2024: ChatGPT signals platform launch**
> - Company: "We don't want our data in ChatGPT. Let's wait and see."
> - Competitors: Integrate immediately, get preferred partnerships
> - Company: "Why are they getting all this distribution?"

**Correct (strategic platform timing):**

> **Platform Assessment Framework:**
>
> 1. **Is there competitive consensus but no winner?** (Step 0)
>    - ChatGPT vs Claude vs Gemini — yes, still battling
>
> 2. **Has a moat been identified?** (Step 1)
>    - ChatGPT: Context + Memory as moat, best retention curves
>
> 3. **Is the platform opening to third parties?** (Step 2)
>    - Signals: Agent platform hiring, preferred partnerships forming
>
> 4. **What's the value exchange?**
>    - "Integrate with us, get distribution to our users"
>
> **Decision:** Place focused bets NOW, not spread thin. Early movers get disproportionate distribution. Plan exit strategy for when platform closes (Step 3).

**Why it matters:**

This is a prisoner's dilemma. If you don't integrate, competitors will. Customer expectations change. Being early and planning for the close beats being late or absent. The cycles are getting shorter — less time to decide.
